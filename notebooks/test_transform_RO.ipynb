The exercise of those tasks implies expenditures for the Board for collecting and analysing information and data related to each subsidiary included in the perimeter of consolidation . Since those are expenditures related to the services provided by the Board to the entities that are subjected to the Single Resolution Mechanism , they should be paid by those entities and therefore the administrative contributions should be calculated on the basis of their consolidated accounts at the highest level of consolidation within the participating Member States and only one contribution per group should be calculated .</p>\n",
