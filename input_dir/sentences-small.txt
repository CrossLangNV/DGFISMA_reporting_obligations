Where the competent authorities consider those contracts to be material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts, which shall correspond to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in its credit quality, such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of that material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into, and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.
3.   The institution shall add an additional outflow which shall correspond to the collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on its derivatives transactions if material.
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions under which the notion of materiality may be applied and specifying methods for the measurement of the additional outflow.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.

‘TITLE IV
THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO
CHAPTER 1
The net stable funding ratio
Article 428a
Application on a consolidated basis
Where the net stable funding ratio set out in this Title applies on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(4), the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
the assets and off-balance-sheet items of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to required stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are higher than those specified in Chapter 4 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the higher factors specified in the national law of that third country;
(b)
the liabilities and own funds of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to available stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are lower than those specified in Chapter 3 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the lower factors specified in the national law of that third country;
(c)
third-country assets which meet the requirements laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and which are held by a subsidiary having its head office in a third country shall not be recognised as liquid assets for consolidation purposes where they do not qualify as liquid assets under the national law of that third country which sets out the liquidity coverage requirement;
(d)
investment firms that are not subject to this Title pursuant to Article 6(4) within the group shall be subject to Articles 413 and 428b on a consolidated basis; except as specified in this point, such investment firms shall remain subject to the detailed net stable funding requirement for investment firms as laid down in national law.
Article 428b
The net stable funding ratio
1.   The net stable funding requirement laid down in Article 413(1) shall be equal to the ratio of the institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 to the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4, and shall be expressed as a percentage. Institutions shall calculate their net stable funding ratio in accordance with the following formula:
2.   Institutions shall maintain a net stable funding ratio of at least 100 %, calculated in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination.
3.   Where, at any time, the net stable funding ratio of an institution has fallen below 100 %, or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100 %, the requirement laid down in Article 414 shall apply. The institution shall aim to restore its net stable funding ratio to the level referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. Competent authorities shall assess the reasons for the institution's failure to comply with paragraph 2 of this Article before taking any supervisory measures.
4.   Institutions shall calculate and monitor their net stable funding ratio in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination, and separately for their transactions denominated in each of the currencies that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).
5.   Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of their funding profile by currency denomination is generally consistent with the distribution of their assets by currency. Where appropriate, competent authorities may require institutions to restrict currency mismatches by setting limits on the proportion of required stable funding in a particular currency that can be met by available stable funding that is not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).
In determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatches that may be applied in accordance with this Article, competent authorities shall at least consider:
(a)
whether the institution has the ability to transfer available stable funding from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group and the ability to swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;
(b)
the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign currency exchange hedges that are in place.
Any restriction on currency mismatches imposed in accordance with this Article shall constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
CHAPTER 2
General rules for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio
Article 428c
Calculation of the net stable funding ratio
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Title, institutions shall take into account assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items on a gross basis.
2.   For the purpose of calculating their net stable funding ratio, institutions shall apply the appropriate stable funding factors set out in Chapters 3 and 4 to the accounting value of their assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, unless otherwise specified in this Title.
3.   Institutions shall not double count required stable funding and available stable funding.
Unless otherwise specified in this Title, where an item can be allocated to more than one required stable funding category, it shall be allocated to the required stable funding category that produces the greatest contractual required stable funding for that item.
Article 428d
Derivative contracts
1.   Institutions shall apply this Article to calculate the amount of required stable funding for derivative contracts as referred to in Chapters 3 and 4.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a net basis where those positions are included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1). Where that is not the case, institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a gross basis and shall treat those derivative positions as belonging to their own netting set for the purposes of Chapter 4.
3.   For the purposes of this Title, the ‘fair value of a netting set’ means the sum of the fair values of all the transactions included in a netting set.
4.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), all derivative contracts listed in points 2(a) to (e) of Annex II that involve a full exchange of principal amounts on the same date shall be calculated on a net basis across currencies, including for the purpose of reporting in a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2), even where those transactions are not included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1).
5.   Cash received as collateral to mitigate the exposure of a derivative position shall be treated as such and shall not be treated as deposits to which Chapter 3 applies.
6.   Competent authorities may decide, with the approval of the relevant central bank, to waive the impact of derivative contracts on the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, including through the determination of the required stable funding factors and of provisions and losses, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
those contracts have a residual maturity of less than six months;
(b)
the counterparty is the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;
(c)
the derivative contracts serve the monetary policy of the ECB or the central bank of a Member State.
Where a subsidiary having its head office in a third country benefits from the waiver referred to in the first subparagraph under the national law of that third country which sets out the net stable funding requirement, that waiver as specified in the national law of the third country shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.
Article 428e
Netting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions
Assets and liabilities resulting from securities financing transactions with a single counterparty shall be calculated on a net basis, provided that those assets and liabilities comply with the netting conditions set out in Article 429b(4).
Article 428f
Interdependent assets and liabilities
1.   Subject to prior approval of the competent authorities, an institution may treat an asset and a liability as interdependent, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the institution acts solely as a pass-through unit to channel the funding from the liability into the corresponding interdependent asset;
(b)
the individual interdependent assets and liabilities are clearly identifiable and have the same principal amount;
(c)
the asset and interdependent liability have substantially matched maturities, with a maximum delay of 20 days between the maturity of the asset and the maturity of the liability;
(d)
the interdependent liability has been requested pursuant to a legal, regulatory or contractual commitment and is not used to fund other assets;
(e)
the principal payment flows from the asset are not used for other purposes than repaying the interdependent liability;
(f)
the counterparties for each pair of interdependent assets and liabilities are not the same.
2.   Assets and liabilities shall be considered to meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and be considered as interdependent where they are directly linked to the following products or services:
(a)
centralised regulated savings, provided that institutions are legally required to transfer regulated deposits to a centralised fund which is set up and controlled by the central government of a Member State and which provides loans to promote public interest objectives, and provided that the transfer of deposits to the centralised fund occurs on at least a monthly basis;
(b)
promotional loans and credit and liquidity facilities that fulfil the criteria set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) for institutions acting as simple intermediaries that do not incur any funding risk;
(c)
covered bonds that meet all the following conditions:
(i)
they are bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC or they meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) of this Regulation;
(ii)
the underlying loans are fully match funded with the covered bonds that were issued or the covered bonds have non-discretionary extendable maturity triggers of one year or more until the term of the underlying loans in the event of refinancing failure at the maturity date of the covered bond;
(d)
derivative client clearing activities, provided that the institution does not provide to its clients guarantees of the performance of the CCP and, as a result, does not incur any funding risk.
3.   EBA shall monitor assets and liabilities, as well as products and services that are treated as interdependent assets and liabilities under paragraphs 1 and 2, to determine whether and to what extent the suitability criteria laid down in paragraph 1 are met. EBA shall report to the Commission on the results of that monitoring and shall advise the Commission on whether an amendment to the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or an amendment to the list of products and services in paragraph 2 would be necessary.
Article 428g
Deposits in institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks
Where an institution belongs to an institutional protection scheme of the type referred to in Article 113(7), to a network that is eligible for the waiver provided for in Article 10, or to a cooperative network in a Member State, the sight deposits that the institution maintains with the central institution and that the depositing institution considers to be liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to the following:
(a)
the depositing institution shall apply the required stable funding factor under Section 2 of Chapter 4, depending on the treatment of those sight deposits as level 1, level 2A or level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and depending on the relevant haircut applied to those sight deposits for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio;
(b)
the central institution receiving the deposit shall apply the corresponding symmetric available stable funding factor.
Article 428h
Preferential treatment within a group or within an institutional protection scheme
1.   By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, where Article 428g does not apply, competent authorities may authorise institutions on a case-by-case basis to apply a higher available stable funding factor or a lower required stable funding factor to assets, liabilities and committed credit or liquidity facilities, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the counterparty is one of the following:
(i)
the parent or a subsidiary of the institution;
(ii)
another subsidiary of the same parent;
(iii)
an undertaking that is related to the institution within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;
(iv)
a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation as the institution;
(v)
the central body or an affiliated credit institution of a network or a cooperative group as referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;
(b)
there are reasons to expect that the liability or committed credit or liquidity facility received by the institution constitutes a more stable source of funding, or that the asset or committed credit or liquidity facility granted by the institution requires less stable funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio than the same liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility received or granted by other counterparties;
(c)
the counterparty applies a required stable funding factor that is equal to or higher than the higher available stable funding factor or applies an available stable funding factor that is equal to or lower than the lower required stable funding factor;
(d)
the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.
2.   Where the institution and the counterparty are established in different Member States, competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 1, provided that, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, the following criteria are met:
(a)
there are legally binding agreements and commitments between group entities regarding the liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility;
(b)
the funding provider presents a low funding risk profile;
(c)
the funding risk profile of the recipient of the funding has been adequately taken into account in the liquidity risk management of the funding provider.
The competent authorities shall consult each other in accordance with point (b) of Article 20(1) to determine whether the additional criteria set out in this paragraph are met.
CHAPTER 3
Available stable funding
Section 1
General provisions
Article 428i
Calculation of the amount of available stable funding
Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.
Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.
Article 428j
Residual maturity of a liability or of own funds
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.
3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.
4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, institutions shall treat any portion of liabilities having a residual maturity of one year or more that matures in less than six months and any portion of such liabilities that matures between six months and less than one year as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Section 2
Available stable funding factors
Article 428k

The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
(a)
variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.

CHAPTER 4
Required stable funding
Section 1
General provisions
Article 428p
Calculation of the amount of required stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.
2.   Assets which institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding where those assets are accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution and the institution does not have beneficial ownership of the asset.
Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 where those assets are not accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution but the institution does have beneficial ownership of the assets.
3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions over which the institution retains beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, even where the assets do not remain on the balance sheet of the institution. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.
Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.
5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that asset is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction in relation to which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered, provided that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.
6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
(a)
assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded, credit lines that are available to the institution; those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with a central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme; institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;
(b)
assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
(c)
assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance.
7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
(a)
by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 428ad and from point (a) of Article 428ah(1), assets encumbered for the purposes of the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
(b)
by way of derogation from points (d)(i) and (d)(ii) of Article 428ad, from point (b) of Article 428af and from point (c) of Article 428ag, monies that result from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.
Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets as referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.
When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and shall take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.
8.   In order to avoid any double counting, institutions shall exclude assets that are associated with collateral that is recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and 428ah(2), recognised as initial margin posted, or recognised as a contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter.
9.   Institutions shall include foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments. They shall exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.
10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.
Competent authorities shall report the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors to EBA at least once a year. They shall include an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors in that report.
Article 428q
Residual maturity of an asset
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.
3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.
4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Section 2
Required stable funding factors
Article 428r
0 % required stable funding factor
1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:

(b)
unencumbered shares or units in CIUs that are eligible for a 0 % haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer set out in that delegated act;
(c)
all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;
(d)

Institutions shall take the monies due referred to in point (g) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph into account on a net basis where Article 428e applies.
2.   By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.
For subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.

2.   For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.

CHAPTER 5
Derogation for small and non-complex institutions
Article 428ai
Derogation for small and non-complex institutions
By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, small and non-complex institutions may choose, with the prior permission of their competent authority, to calculate the ratio between an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 6, and the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 7, expressed as a percentage.
A competent authority may require a small and non-complex institution to comply with the net stable funding requirement based on an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 and the required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4 where it considers that the simplified methodology is not adequate to capture the funding risks of that institution.
CHAPTER 6
Available stable funding for the simplified calculation of the net stable funding ratio
Section 1
General provisions
Article 428aj
Simplified calculation of the amount of available stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.
2.   Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.
Article 428ak
Residual maturity of a liability or own funds
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.
3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.
4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, for liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year, shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Section 2
Available stable funding factors
Article 428al
0 % available stable funding factor
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Section, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:
(a)
deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;
(b)
minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument concerned.
2.   Deferred tax liabilities and minority interests as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to one of the following factors:
(a)
0 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than one year;
(b)
100 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more.
3.   The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor:
(a)
trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, of foreign currencies and of commodities, that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;

4.   Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.
The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
(a)
variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.
Article 428am
50 % available stable funding factor

CHAPTER 7
Required stable funding for the simplified calculation of the net stable funding ratio
Section 1
General provisions
Article 428aq
Simplified calculation of the amount of required stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, for small and non-complex institutions the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.
2.   Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are not accounted for in their balance sheet but on which they have beneficial ownership shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions, over which they retain beneficial ownership, even where they do not remain on their balance sheet, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.
Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.
5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.
6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
(a)
assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution, including assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme;
(b)
assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
(c)
assets attached as non-mandatory over-collateralisation to a covered bond issuance.
For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer.
7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
(a)
by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (a) of Article 428az(1), assets encumbered for the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
(b)
by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (b) of Article 428ay, monies resulting from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.
Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.
When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.
8.   Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and Article 428ah(2) or as initial margin posted or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double counting.
9.   Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.
10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.
Competent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.
Article 428ar
Residual maturity of an asset
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.
3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.
4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portions that mature in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.
Section 2
Required stable funding factors
Article 428as
0 % required stable funding factor
1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:
(a)
unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 high quality liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements as set out in that delegated act;

all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;
(c)
all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;
(d)
assets that are categorised as being interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f.
2.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.
For subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.
Article 428at
5 % required stable funding factor
1.   The undrawn portion of committed credit and liquidity facilities specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 5 % required stable funding factor.
2.   For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.
Article 428au
10 % required stable funding factor
The following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 10 % required stable funding factor:
(a)

Article 428aw
50 % required stable funding factor
The following assets shall be subject to a 50 % required stable funding factor:
(a)
secured and unsecured loans with a residual maturity of less than one year and provided that they are encumbered less than one year;
(b)
any other assets with a residual maturity of less than one year, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428as to 428av;
(c)
assets encumbered for a residual maturity of at least six months but less than one year, except where those assets would be assigned a higher required stable funding factor in accordance with Articles 428ax, 428ay and 428az if they were held unencumbered, in which case the higher required stable funding factor that would apply to those assets if they were held unencumbered shall apply.
Article 428ax
55 % required stable funding factor
Assets that are eligible as level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), and shares or units in CIUs pursuant to that delegated act shall be subject to a 55 % required stable funding factor, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act, provided that they are encumbered less than one year.

The following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 85 % required stable funding factor:
(a)
any assets and off-balance-sheet items, including cash, posted as initial margin for derivative contracts or posted as contribution to the default fund of a CCP, unless those assets would be assigned a higher required stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428az if held unencumbered, in which case the higher required stable funding factor that would apply to those assets if they were held unencumbered shall apply;
(b)
unencumbered loans with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding loans to financial customers, which are not past due for more than 90 days;
(c)
trade finance on-balance-sheet related products, with a residual maturity of one year or more;

2.   Institutions shall apply a 100 % required stable funding factor to the difference, if positive, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.
The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
(a)
variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.’;

Part Seven is replaced by the following:
‘PART SEVEN
LEVERAGE
Article 429
Calculation of the leverage ratio
1.   Institutions shall calculate their leverage ratio in accordance with the methodology set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
2.   The leverage ratio shall be calculated as an institution's capital measure divided by that institution's total exposure measure and shall be expressed as a percentage.
Institutions shall calculate the leverage ratio at the reporting reference date.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital.
4.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the total exposure measure shall be the sum of the exposure values of:
(a)
assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e, calculated in accordance with Article 429b(1);
(b)
derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, including those contracts and credit derivatives that are off-balance-sheet, calculated in accordance with Articles 429c and 429d;

(e)
regular-way purchases or sales awaiting settlement, calculated in accordance with Article 429g.
Institutions shall treat long settlement transactions in accordance with points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph, as applicable.
Institutions may reduce the exposure values referred to in points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph by the corresponding amount of general credit risk adjustments to on- and off-balance-sheet items, respectively, subject to a floor of 0 where the credit risk adjustments have reduced the Tier 1 capital.
5.   By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 4, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
a derivative instrument that is considered an off-balance-sheet item in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 4 but is treated as a derivative in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, shall be subject to the treatment set out in that point;
(b)
where a client of an institution acting as a clearing member enters directly into a derivative transaction with a CCP and the institution guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures to the CCP arising from that transaction, the institution shall calculate its exposure resulting from the guarantee in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 4, as if that institution had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin.
The treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall also apply to an institution acting as a higher-level client that guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph and of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may consider an affiliated entity as a client only where that entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation at the level at which the requirement set out in point (d) of Article 92(3) is applied.
6.   For the purposes of point (e) of paragraph 4 of this Article and Article 429g, ‘regular-way purchase or sale’ means a purchase or a sale of a security under contracts for which the terms require delivery of the security within the period established generally by law or convention in the marketplace concerned.
7.   Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this Part, institutions shall calculate the total exposure measure in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce the total exposure measure;
(b)
assets shall not be netted with liabilities.
8.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 7, institutions may reduce the exposure value of a pre-financing loan or an intermediate loan by the positive balance on the savings account of the debtor to which the loan was granted and only include the resulting amount in the total exposure measure, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the granting of the loan is conditional upon the opening of the savings account at the institution granting the loan and both the loan and the savings account are regulated by the same sectoral law;
(b)
the balance on the savings account cannot be withdrawn, in part or in full, by the debtor for the entire duration of the loan;
(c)
the institution can unconditionally and irrevocably use the balance on the savings account to settle any claim originating under the loan agreement in cases regulated by the sectoral law referred to in point (a), including the case of non-payment by or the insolvency of the debtor.
‘Pre-financing loan’ or ‘intermediate loan’ means a loan that is granted to the borrower for a limited period of time in order to bridge the borrower's financing gaps until the final loan is granted in accordance with the criteria laid down in the sectoral law regulating such transactions.

For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph, and without prejudice to the Union State aid rules and the obligations of the Member States thereunder, competent authorities may, upon request of an institution, treat an organisationally, structurally and financially independent and autonomous unit of that institution as a public development credit institution, provided that the unit fulfils all the conditions listed in the first subparagraph and that such treatment does not affect the effectiveness of the supervision of that institution. Competent authorities shall without delay notify the Commission and EBA of any decision to treat, for the purposes of this subparagraph, a unit of an institution as a public development credit institution. The competent authority shall annually review such decision.
3.   For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of paragraph 1 and point (d) of paragraph 2, ‘promotional loan’ means a loan granted by a public development credit institution or an entity set up by the central government, regional government or local authority of a Member State, directly or through an intermediate credit institution on a non-competitive, not-for-profit basis, in order to promote the public policy objectives of the central government, regional government or local authority in a Member State.
4.   Institutions shall not exclude the trade exposures referred to in points (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, where the condition set out in the third subparagraph of Article 429(5) is not met.
5.   Institutions may exclude the exposures listed in point (n) of paragraph 1 where both of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the institution's competent authority has determined, after consultation with the relevant central bank, and publicly declared that exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the exclusion in order to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies;
(b)
the exemption is granted for a limited period of time not exceeding one year.
6.   The exposures to be excluded under point (n) of paragraph 1 shall meet both of the following conditions:
(a)
they are denominated in the same currency as the deposits taken by the institution;
(b)
their average maturity does not significantly exceed the average maturity of the deposits taken by the institution.
7.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(1), where an institution excludes the exposures referred to in point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall at all times satisfy the following adjusted leverage ratio requirement for the duration of the exclusion:
where:
aLR
=
the adjusted leverage ratio;
EMLR
=
the institution's total exposure measure as defined in Article 429(4), including the exposures excluded in accordance with point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article; and
CB
=
the amount of exposures excluded in accordance with point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 429b
Calculation of the exposure value of assets
1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
the exposure values of assets means an exposure value as referred to in the first sentence of Article 111(1);
(b)
securities financing transactions shall not be netted.
2.   A cash pooling arrangement offered by an institution does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7) only where the arrangement meets both of the following conditions:
(a)
the institution offering the cash pooling arrangement transfers the credit and debit balances of several individual accounts of entities of a group included in the arrangement (‘original accounts’) into a separate, single account and thereby sets the balances of the original accounts to zero;
(b)
the institution carries out the actions referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph on a daily basis.
For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 3, cash pooling arrangement means an arrangement whereby the credit or debit balances of several individual accounts are combined for the purposes of cash or liquidity management.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, a cash pooling arrangement that does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph, but meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7), provided that the arrangement meets all the following conditions:
(a)
the institution has a legally enforceable right to set off the balances of the original accounts through the transfer into a single account at any point in time;
(b)
there are no maturity mismatches between the balances of the original accounts;
(c)
the institution charges or pays interest based on the combined balance of the original accounts;
(d)
the competent authority of the institution considers that the frequency by which the balances of all original accounts are transferred is adequate for the purpose of including only the combined balance of the cash pooling arrangement in the total exposure measure.
4.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate the exposure value of cash receivable and cash payable under securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis only where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;
(b)
the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy;
(c)
the counterparties intend to settle on a net basis or to settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement.
5.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 4, institutions may consider that a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement only where, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement and all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the transactions are settled through the same settlement system or settlement systems using a common settlement infrastructure;
(b)
the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that the settlement of the transactions will occur by the end of the business day;
(c)
any issues arising from the securities legs of the securities financing transactions do not interfere with the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.
The condition set out in point (c) of the first subparagraph is met only where the failure of any securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism may delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or may create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.
Where there is a failure of the securities leg of a securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement mechanism, institutions shall split out this transaction and its matching cash leg from the netting set and treat them on a gross basis.
Article 429c
Calculation of the exposure value of derivatives
1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance-sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three.
When calculating the exposure value, institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Institutions shall not take into account cross-product netting, but may net within the product category as referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives where they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement as referred to in point (c) of Article 295.
Institutions shall include in the total exposure measure sold options even where their exposure value can be set to zero in accordance with the treatment laid down in Article 274(5).
2.   Where the provision of collateral related to derivative contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions calculating the replacement cost of derivative contracts in accordance with Article 275 may recognise only collateral received in cash from their counterparties as the variation margin referred to in Article 275, where the applicable accounting framework has not already recognised the variation margin as a reduction of the exposure value and where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated;
(b)
the variation margin is calculated and exchanged at least daily based on a mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;
(c)
the variation margin received is in a currency specified in the derivative contract, governing master netting agreement, credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement or as defined by any netting agreement with a QCCP;
(d)
the variation margin received is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative contract subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts that are applicable to the counterparty;
(e)
the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295.
Where an institution provides cash collateral to a counterparty and that collateral meets the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph, the institution shall consider that collateral as the variation margin posted with the counterparty and shall include it in the calculation of the replacement cost.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution shall be considered to have met the condition set out therein where the variation margin is exchanged on the morning of the trading day following the trading day on which the derivative contract was stipulated, provided that the exchange is based on the value of the contract at the end of the trading day on which the contract was stipulated.
For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, where a margin dispute arises, institutions may recognise the amount of non-disputed collateral that has been exchanged.
4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall not include collateral received in the calculation of NICA as defined in point (12a) of Article 272, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.
5.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall set the value of the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 278(1) to one, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Section 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to determine the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II, but only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92.
Where institutions apply one of the methods referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall not reduce the total exposure measure by the amount of margin they have received.
Article 429d
Additional provisions on the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives
1.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘written credit derivative’ means any financial instrument through which an institution effectively provides credit protection including credit default swaps, total return swaps and options where the institution has the obligation to provide credit protection under conditions specified in the options contract.
2.   In addition to the calculation laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.
Institutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.
3.   Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;
(b)
the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;
(c)
the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to Specific Wrong-Way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);
(d)
where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution's Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;
(e)
the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the total exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 429a(1), as applicable.
For the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the total exposure measure.
4.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3, ‘material term’ means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative. Two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity.
5.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same.
6.   Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital.
7.   In the case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 3 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.
Article 429e
Counterparty credit risk add-on for securities financing transactions
1.   In addition to the calculation of the exposure value of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet in accordance with Article 429b(1), institutions shall include in the total exposure measure an add-on for counterparty credit risk calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable.
2.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are not subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on a transaction-by-transaction basis in accordance with the following formula:
where:
=
the add-on;
i
=
the index that denotes the transaction;
Ei
=
the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty under transaction i; and
Ci
=
the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty under transaction i.
3.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on an agreement-by-agreement basis in accordance with the following formula:
where:
=
the add-on;
i
=
the index that denotes the netting agreement;
Ei
=
the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty for the transactions that are subject to master netting agreement i; and
Ci
=
the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty that is subject to master netting agreement i.
4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the term counterparty includes also tri-party agents that receive collateral in deposit and manage the collateral in the case of tri-party transactions.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 222, subject to a 20 % floor for the applicable risk weight, to determine the add-on for securities financing transactions including those that are off-balance-sheet. Institutions may use that method only where they also use it for calculating the exposure value of those transactions for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements as set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1).
6.   Where sale accounting is achieved for a repurchase transaction under the applicable accounting framework, the institution shall reverse all sales-related accounting entries.
7.   Where an institution acts as an agent between two parties in a securities financing transaction, including an off-balance-sheet transaction, the following provisions shall apply to the calculation of the institution's total exposure measure:
(a)
where the institution provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the parties in the securities financing transaction and the indemnity or guarantee is limited to any difference between the value of the security or cash the party has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, the institution shall only include the add-on calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, in the total exposure measure;
(b)
where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the total exposure measure;
(c)
where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or the cash in the transaction to an amount greater than the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include in the total exposure measure also the full amount of the security or the cash to which it is exposed;
(d)
where the institution acting as agent provides an indemnity or guarantee to both parties involved in a securities financing transaction, the institution shall calculate its total exposure measure in accordance with points (a), (b) and (c) separately for each party involved in the transaction.
Article 429f
Calculation of the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items
1.   Institutions shall calculate, in accordance with Article 111(1), the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and positions referred to in Article 429d.
Where a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, Article 166(9) shall apply.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may reduce the credit exposure equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet item by the corresponding amount of specific credit risk adjustments. The calculation shall be subject to a floor of zero.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall apply a conversion factor of 10 % to low-risk off-balance-sheet items referred to in point (d) of Article 111(1).
Article 429g
Calculation of the exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement
1.   Institutions shall treat cash related to regular-way sales and securities related to regular-way purchases which remain on the balance sheet until the settlement date as assets in accordance with point (a) of Article 429(4).
2.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply trade date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall reverse out any offsetting between cash receivables for regular-way sales awaiting settlement and cash payables for regular-way purchase awaiting settlement allowed under that framework. After institutions have reversed out the accounting offsetting, they may offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where both the related regular-way sales and purchases are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.
3.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply settlement date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall include in the total exposure measure the full nominal value of commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases.
Institutions may offset the full nominal value of the commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases by the full nominal value of cash receivables related to regular-way sales awaiting settlement only where both of the following conditions are met:
(a)
both the regular-way purchases and sales are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis;
(b)
the financial assets bought and sold that are associated with cash payables and receivables are fair valued through profit and loss and included in the institution's trading book.

‘PART SEVEN A
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Article 430
Reporting on prudential requirements and financial information
1.   Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on:
(a)
own funds requirements, including the leverage ratio, as set out in Article 92 and Part Seven;
(b)
the requirements laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, for institutions that are subject to those requirements;
(c)
large exposures as set out in Article 394;
(d)
liquidity requirements as set out in Article 415;
(e)
the aggregate data for each national immovable property market as set out in Article 430a(1);
(f)
the requirements and guidance set out in Directive 2013/36/EU qualified for standardised reporting, except for any additional reporting requirement under point (j) of Article 104(1) of that Directive;
(g)
the level of asset encumbrance, including a breakdown by the type of asset encumbrance, such as repurchase agreements, securities lending, securitised exposures or loans.
Institutions exempted in accordance with Article 6(5) shall not be subject to the reporting requirement on the leverage ratio set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph on an individual basis.
2.   In addition to the reporting on the leverage ratio referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in order to enable the competent authorities to monitor leverage ratio volatility, in particular around reporting reference dates, large institutions shall report specific components of the leverage ratio to their competent authorities based on averages over the reporting period and the data used to calculate those averages.
3.   In addition to the reporting on prudential requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report financial information to their competent authorities where they are one of the following:
(a)
an institution that is subject to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;
(b)
a credit institution that prepares its consolidated accounts in accordance with the international accounting standards pursuant to point (b) of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.
4.   Competent authorities may require credit institutions that determine their own funds on a consolidated basis in accordance with international accounting standards pursuant to Article 24(2) to report financial information in accordance with this Article.
5.   The reporting on financial information referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall only comprise information that is needed to provide a comprehensive view of the institution's risk profile and the systemic risks posed by the institution to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
6.   The reporting requirements laid down in this Article shall be applied to institutions in a proportionate manner taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 8, having regard to their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities.
7.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the uniform reporting formats and templates, the instructions and methodology on how to use those templates, the frequency and dates of reporting, the definitions and the IT solutions for the reporting referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4.
Any new reporting requirements set out in such implementing technical standards shall not be applicable earlier than six months from the date of their entry into force.
For the purposes of paragraph 2, the draft implementing technical standards shall specify which components of the leverage ratio shall be reported using day-end or month-end values. For that purpose, EBA shall take into account both of the following:
(a)
how susceptible a component is to significant temporary reductions in transaction volumes that could result in an underrepresentation of the risk of excessive leverage at the reporting reference date;
(b)
developments and findings at international level.
EBA shall submit to the Commission the draft implementing technical standards referred to in this paragraph by 28 June 2021, except in relation to the following:
(a)
the leverage ratio, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020;
(b)
the obligations laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
8.   EBA shall assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (*14) in accordance with this paragraph and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. That assessment shall be carried out in particular in relation to small and non-complex institutions. For those purposes, the report shall:
(a)
classify institutions into categories based on their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities;
(b)
measure the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions during the relevant period to meet the reporting requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, taking into account the following principles:
(i)
the reporting costs shall be measured as the ratio of the reporting costs relative to the institution's total costs during the relevant period;
(ii)
the reporting costs shall comprise all expenditure related to the implementation and operation on an on-going basis of the reporting systems, including expenditure on staff, IT systems, legal, accounting, auditing and consultancy services;
(iii)
the relevant period shall refer to each annual period during which institutions have incurred reporting costs to prepare for the implementation of the reporting requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and to continue operating the reporting systems on an on-going basis;
(c)
assess whether the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered by the reporting requirements for the purposes of prudential supervision;
(d)
assess the effects of a reduction of reporting requirement on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and
(e)
make recommendations on how to reduce reporting requirements at least for small and non-complex institutions, to which end EBA shall target an expected average cost reduction of at least 10 % but ideally a 20 % cost reduction. EBA shall, in particular, assess whether:
(i)
the reporting requirements referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 could be waived for small and non-complex institutions where asset encumbrance was below a certain threshold;
(ii)
the reporting frequency required in accordance with points (a), (c), and (g) of paragraph 1 could be reduced for small and non-complex institutions.
EBA shall accompany that report by draft implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7.
9.   Competent authorities shall consult EBA on whether institutions, other than those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, should report on financial information on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 3, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the relevant institutions are not already reporting on a consolidated basis;
(b)
the relevant institutions are subject to an accounting framework in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC;
(c)
financial reporting is considered necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the risk profile of those institutions' activities and of the systemic risks they pose to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the formats and templates that institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall use for the purposes set out therein.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
10.   Where a competent authority considers information not covered by the implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7 as necessary for the purposes set out in paragraph 5, it shall notify EBA and the ESRB of the additional information it considers necessary to include in the implementing technical standards referred to in that paragraph.
11.   Competent authorities may waive the requirement to submit any of the data points set out in the reporting templates specified in the implementing technical standards referred to in this Article where those data points are duplicative. For those purposes, duplicative data points shall refer to any data points which are already available to the competent authorities by means other than by collecting those reporting templates, including where those data points can be obtained from data that is already available to the competent authorities in different formats or levels of granularity; the competent authority may only grant the waivers referred to in this paragraph if data received, collated or aggregated through such alternative methods are identical to those data points which would otherwise have to be reported in accordance with the respective implementing technical standards.
Competent authorities, resolution authorities and designated authorities shall make use of data exchange wherever possible to reduce reporting requirements. The provisions on the exchange of information and professional secrecy as laid down in Section II of Chapter I of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU shall apply.
Article 430a
Specific reporting obligations
1.   Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on an annual basis the following aggregate data for each national immovable property market to which they are exposed:

(b)
overall losses stemming from exposures for which an institution has recognised residential property as collateral, up to the part of the exposure treated as fully secured by residential property in accordance with Article 124(1);
(c)
the exposure value of all outstanding exposures for which an institution has recognised residential property as collateral limited to the part treated as fully secured by residential property in accordance with Article 124(1);

2.   The data referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reported to the competent authority of the home Member State of the relevant institution. Where an institution has a branch in another Member State, the data relating to that branch shall also be reported to the competent authorities of the host Member State. The data shall be reported separately for each immovable property market within the Union to which the relevant institution is exposed.
3.   The competent authorities shall publish annually on an aggregated basis the data specified in points (a) to (f) of paragraph 1, together with historical data, where available. A competent authority shall, upon the request of another competent authority in a Member State or EBA provide to that competent authority or EBA more detailed information on the condition of the residential property or commercial immovable property markets in that Member State.
Article 430b
Specific reporting requirements for market risk
1.   From the date of application of the delegated act referred to in Article 461a, institutions that do not meet the conditions set out in Article 94(1) nor the conditions set out in Article 325a(1) shall report, for all their trading book positions and all their non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risks, the results of the calculations based on using the alternative standardised approach set out in Chapter 1a of Title IV of Part Three on the same basis as such institutions report the obligations laid down in points (b)(i) and (c) of Article 92(3).

Article 431
Disclosure requirements and policies
1.   Institutions shall publicly disclose the information referred to in Titles II and III in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Title, subject to the exceptions referred to in Article 432.
2.   Institutions that have been granted permission by the competent authorities under Part Three for the instruments and methodologies referred to in Title III of this Part shall publicly disclose the information laid down therein.
3.   The management body or senior management shall adopt formal policies to comply with the disclosure requirements laid down in this Part and put in place and maintain internal processes, systems and controls to verify that the institutions' disclosures are appropriate and in compliance with the requirements laid down in this Part. At least one member of the management body or senior management shall attest in writing that the relevant institution has made the disclosures required under this Part in accordance with the formal policies and internal processes, systems and controls. The written attestation and the key elements of the institution's formal policies to comply with the disclosure requirements shall be included in institutions' disclosures.
Information to be disclosed in accordance with this Part shall be subject to the same level of internal verification as that applicable to the management report included in the institution's financial report.
Institutions shall also have policies in place to verify that their disclosures convey their risk profile comprehensively to market participants. Where institutions find that the disclosures required under this Part do not convey the risk profile comprehensively to market participants, they shall publicly disclose information in addition to the information required to be disclosed under this Part. Nonetheless, institutions shall only be required to disclose information that is material and not proprietary or confidential as referred to in Article 432.
4.   All quantitative disclosures shall be accompanied by a qualitative narrative and any other supplementary information that may be necessary in order for the users of that information to understand the quantitative disclosures, noting in particular any significant change in any given disclosure compared to the information contained in the previous disclosures.
5.   Institutions shall, if requested, explain their rating decisions to SMEs and other corporate applicants for loans, providing an explanation in writing when asked. The administrative costs of that explanation shall be proportionate to the size of the loan.
Article 432
Non-material, proprietary or confidential information
1.   With the exception of the disclosures laid down in point (c) of Article 435(2) and in Articles 437 and 450, institutions may omit one or more of the disclosures listed in Titles II and III where the information provided by those disclosures is not regarded as material.
Information in disclosures shall be regarded as material where its omission or misstatement could change or influence the assessment or decision of a user of that information relying on it for the purpose of making economic decisions.
EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on how institutions have to apply materiality in relation to the disclosure requirements of Titles II and III.
2.   Institutions may also omit one or more items of information referred to in Titles II and III where those items include information that is regarded as proprietary or confidential in accordance with this paragraph, except for the disclosures laid down in Articles 437 and 450.
Information shall be regarded as proprietary to institutions where disclosing it publicly would undermine their competitive position. Proprietary information may include information on products or systems that would render the investments of institutions therein less valuable, if shared with competitors.
Information shall be regarded as confidential where the institutions are obliged by customers or other counterparty relationships to keep that information confidential.
EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on how institutions have to apply proprietary and confidentiality in relation to the disclosure requirements of Titles II and III.
3.   In the exceptional cases referred to in paragraph 2, the institution concerned shall state in its disclosures the fact that specific items of information are not being disclosed and the reason for not disclosing those items, and publish more general information about the subject matter of the disclosure requirement, except where that subject matter is, in itself, proprietary or confidential.

Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article identifies changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State and which that authority considers that cannot be addressed by means of other macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU as effectively as by implementing stricter national measures, it shall notify the Commission and the ESRB accordingly. The ESRB shall forward the notification to the European Parliament, to the Council and to EBA without delay.
The notification shall be accompanied by the following documents and include, where appropriate, relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence on:

Within one month of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the matters referred to in points (a) to (f) of that paragraph to the Council, to the Commission and to the Member State concerned.
Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.
In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.
The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.
The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not met:
(a)
the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;
(b)
the macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are less suitable or effective than the draft national measures to deal with the macroprudential or systemic risk identified;
(c)
the draft national measures do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market; and
(d)
the issue concerns only one Member State.
The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1.
In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month of receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State concerned may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.

paragraphs 9 and 10 are replaced by the following:
‘9.   Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State concerned shall, in consultation with the ESRB and EBA, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for up to two additional years each time. After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least every two years thereafter.
10.   Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9 of this Article, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided for in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (d)(iv) and (d)(vii) of paragraph 2 of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.’;

the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.
10.   By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.
11.   EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less.

(a)
whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent;
(b)
whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules;
(c)
how internationally agreed standards for systemic institutions interact with the provisions in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards;
(d)
whether other types of instruments, such as borrower-based instruments, should be added to the macroprudential tools provided for in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU to complement capital-based instruments and to allow for the harmonised use of the instruments in the internal market; taking into account whether harmonised definitions of those instruments and the reporting of respective data at Union level are a prerequisite for the introduction of such instruments;
(e)
whether the leverage ratio buffer requirement as referred to in Article 92(1a) should be extended to systemically important institutions other than G-SIIs, whether its calibration should be different from the calibration for G-SIIs, and whether its calibration should depend on the level of systemic importance of the institution;
(f)
whether the current voluntary reciprocity of macroprudnetial measures should be turned into mandatory reciprocity and whether the current ESRB framework for voluntary reciprocity is an appropriate basis for that;

KCCP
=
the hypothetical capital;
i
=
the index denoting the clearing member;
EADi
=
the exposure amount of the CCP to clearing member i, including the clearing member's own transactions with the CCP, the client transactions guaranteed by the clearing member, and all values of collateral held by the CCP, including the clearing member's pre-funded default fund contribution, against those transactions, relating to the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged;

Article 50b is replaced by the following:
‘Article 50b
General rules for the calculation of KCCP
For the purpose of calculating KCCP referred to in Article 50a(2), the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
CCPs shall calculate the value of the exposures they have to their clearing members as follows:
(i)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in points (a) and (c) of Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, CCPs shall calculate the value in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three of that Regulation by using a margin period of risk of 10 business days;
(ii)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in point (b) of Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, CCPs shall calculate the value (EADi) in accordance with the following formula:
EADi = max{EBRMi – IMi – DFi; 0}
where:
EADi
=
the exposure value;
i
=
the index denoting the clearing member;
EBRMi
=
the exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member;
IMi
=
the initial margin posted with the CCP by clearing member i;
DFi
=
the pre-funded default fund contribution of clearing member i.
All values in this formula shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged;
(iii)
for situations referred to in the third sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, CCPs shall calculate the value of the transactions referred to in the first sentence of that subparagraph in accordance with the formula set out in point (a)(ii) of this Article, and shall determine EBRMi in accordance with Title V of Part Three of that Regulation;
(b)
for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in point (4) of Article 272 of that Regulation;
(c)
a CCP that has exposures to one or more CCPs shall treat those exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;
(d)
a CCP that has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows that CCP to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions shall consider that initial margin as pre-funded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;
(e)
where collateral is held against an account containing more than one of the types of contracts and transactions referred to in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, CCPs shall allocate the initial margin provided by their clearing members or clients, as applicable, in proportion to the EADs of the respective types of contracts and transactions calculated in accordance with point (a) of this paragraph, without taking into account initial margin in the calculation;
(f)
CCPs that have more than one default fund shall carry out the calculation for each default fund separately;
(g)
where a clearing member provides client clearing services, and the transactions and collateral of the clearing member's clients are held in sub-accounts which are separate from those of the clearing member's proprietary business, CCPs shall carry out the calculation of EADi for each sub-account separately and shall calculate the clearing member's total EADi as the sum of the EADs of the clients' sub-accounts and the EAD of the clearing member's proprietary business sub-account;
(h)
for the purposes of point (f), where DFi is not split between the clients' sub-accounts and the clearing member's proprietary business sub-accounts, CCPs shall allocate DFi per sub-account according to the respective fraction the initial margin of that sub-account has in relation to the total initial margin posted by the clearing member or for the account of the clearing member;
(i)
CCPs shall not carry out the calculation in accordance with Article 50a(2) where the default fund covers cash transactions only.
For the purposes of point (a)(ii) of this Article, the CCP shall use the method specified in Article 223 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 with supervisory volatility adjustments set out in Article 224 of that Regulation to calculate the exposure value.’;
(3)
in Article 50c(1), points (d) and (e) are deleted;
(4)
in Article 50d, point (c) is deleted;
(5)
in Article 89, paragraph 5a is replaced by the following:
‘5a.   During the transitional period set out in Article 497 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP referred to in that Article shall include in the information it shall report in accordance with Article 50c(1) of this Regulation the total amount of initial margin, as defined in point (140) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it has received from its clearing members where both of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the CCP does not have a default fund;
(b)
the CCP does not have in place a binding arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from those clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions.’.
