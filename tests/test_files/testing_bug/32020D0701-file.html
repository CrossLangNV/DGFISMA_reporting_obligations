In order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the authorities of the partners under the supervision of the committee of representatives of Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially significant impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure as specified in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 be used for operations above that threshold. Considering the amount of the Union’s macro‐financial assistance to each partner, the advisory procedure should apply to the adoption of the MOU with Montenegro, while the examination procedure should apply to the adoption of the MOU with the other partners covered by this Decision, and correspondingly to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of that assistance.</p>
