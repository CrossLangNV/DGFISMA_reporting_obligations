A safe and secure society is a prerequisite for economic growth and the well-being of citizens. A number of <span class="italic">cross-border health threats</span> in the past few years have clearly demonstrated the need and value-added of coherent and effective action at EU level. Actions envisaged under this work plan focus on exploring and setting up efficient mechanisms for detecting and preventing the spread of various cross-border health threats, or minimising their impact. This work plan also envisages support for safe and secure systems and mechanisms in support of <span class="italic">EU legislation</span> on the <span class="italic">safety and quality of organs and substances of human origin, blood, and blood derivatives</span>. Activities seek to obtain and maintain the trust and confidence of EU citizens in this area. In the same way, <span class="italic">legislation in the area of cross-border healthcare</span> will be supported by targeted action.</p>
      <p class="normal">Keeping people healthy and active for longer has a positive impact on productivity and competitiveness.

      <p class="normal">The collection and supply of blood and blood components is a high-value activity for the Member States’ public health systems, offering and supporting many treatment options. These activities also contribute to developments in the pharmaceutical sector. The risk of transmitting diseases is inherent to the use of blood and blood components and can lead to potential safety and quality risks. Directive 2002/98/EC and related implementing measures seek to respond to these concerns. The tissues and cells sector is growing fast, providing an increasing number of treatments. It will contribute to economic growth as well as to the development of the pharmaceutical sector. This will only be possible if the safety and quality of collected substances of human origin can be guaranteed. Directive 2004/23/EC and related implementing Directives seek to respond to these concerns.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">The objective of this action is to support Member States in organising optimal allocation and use/transplantation of donated organs through multilateral and bilateral arrangements and through transplantation in other Member States. This action will help implement Commission Communication COM(2008) 819/3 of 8 December 2008<span class="italic">Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015): Strengthened Cooperation between Member States</span>

      <p class="normal">This action seeks to set up an EU-level IT platform for the multilateral exchange of organs. Most Member States have national allocation bodies to match available organs with potential recipients and ensure the optimal allocation and use of every organ. Some Member States have joined efforts within a multi-country exchange organisation, such as <span class="italic">Eurotransplant</span> and <span class="italic">Scandiatransplant</span>. However, not all organs can be matched, allocated and used within these countries or multi-country zones. This is particularly true for highly immunised patients, children and rare organs. An EU-level platform that connects the existing organ allocation bodies in Europe will enable this. This action covers the development of protocols and agreed formats for easy and fast data exchange. Preparatory work has already been undertaken within the ‘Coordinating a European initiative among national organisations for organ transplantation’ (COORENOR) project funded by the health programme. This will be developed further, a concrete platform will be set up and the number of Member States involved will be increased. Careful legal, financial and operational preparation leading to concrete agreements between Member States will contribute to the sustainability of the platform.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action will also help national authorities to establish bilateral agreements to exchange organs between Member States. Not all Member States have transplant programmes for every type of organ. Establishing organ-specific bilateral agreements between Member States gives EU citizens’ access to care in a transplant centre in another Member State that is specialised in the organ of their need. These organs can also be procured in one Member State and sent to another. Existing agreements have increased the mobility of patients and utilisation of organs in Europe. This action will explore existing practices, identify opportunities for bilateral agreements, help Member States develop bilateral agreements and establish an operational set-up. Work undertaken within the COORENOR project will contribute to this.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action will also address issues which hinder EU citizens in accessing transplantation programmes in other Member States. This action will deliver an overview of patient mobility patterns in the Member States for organ transplantation and related problems, together with proposals to address these. This action will also deliver an overview of consent systems and methods for the mutual understanding of these systems by the Member States to facilitate donation in other Member States when potential organ donors die outside their national borders. The estimated time of delivery of results is end-2015.</p>

      <p class="normal">The objective of this action is to help effectively disseminate best practices in the donation and transplantation of organs, tissues, cells and blood through the Council of Europe (CoE). This action derives from several projects funded by the health programme and the work done by various working groups to identify and develop best practices in the EU. These cover in particular: (a) public awareness campaigns; (b) donor identification, recruitment and management; (c) living donation of organs; (d) quality practices in blood and tissue establishments, in particular on collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution; (e) monitoring the safety of human substances; (f) collaboration with intensive care units; and (g) follow-up of post-donation and post-transplant/transfusion.</p>
      <p class="normal">Owing to its outreach and structure, CoE can significantly contribute to the dissemination of best practice and reach out to additional audiences. These include health professionals and establishments, represented in many of the expert groups managed by CoE, and representatives of competent authorities in its expert groups. These competent authorities are responsible for organising donation, transplantation and transfusion activities in the Member States.</p>
      <p class="normal">To leverage this outreach and make sure that additional groups are able to benefit from the knowledge developed with the help of EU funding, CoE will develop and implement a dissemination plan for different target groups and geographic coverage. Concrete activities may include conferences, platform building, awareness campaigns, distribution of references through emailing/websites, publication of leaflets/guidance materials and training.</p>
      <p class="normal">These activities will contribute to a better implementation of the safety and quality requirements as laid down in Directive 2010/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation<a id="ntc21-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0021" href="#ntr21-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0021"> (<span class="super">21</span>)</a>; Directive 2002/98/EC and its implementing legislation, and Directive 2004/23/EC and its implementing legislation.

      <p class="normal">The objectives of this action are to analyse the consumption of tobacco in various groups in society and the role of tobacco use as a contributor to the current and future gap in health outcomes. It will also analyse the impact of the interventions taken by the EU, Member States and third countries to reduce tobacco-related inequalities. These measures target in particular lower educational, occupational and income groups, different gender and age groups and specific socially disadvantaged groups, such as disabled persons, homeless people, young people with special needs and migrants.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action will provide a comprehensive picture of the challenges posed by tobacco-related inequalities throughout the EU, providing an evidence base and contribute to the sharing of best practices. Given that certain marginal groups are difficult to reach, it is useful for the Member States to learn from each other’s experience and avoid using resources on measures that have proved ineffective. This action will deliver a study presenting a comprehensive analysis of current and future tobacco-related inequalities and an overview of the most cost-effective measures to address these. It will contain recommendations on integrating health equity considerations into tobacco-control policies and legislation at Member States’ and EU level. Expected results will provide national and EU policy-makers with a thorough understanding of good practices in reducing tobacco-related inequalities. The estimated timeline for the delivery of the study is end-2013.</p>

      <p class="normal">The objective of this action is to support the Member States in implementing Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare<a id="ntc27-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0027" href="#ntr27-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0027"> (<span class="super">27</span>)</a>. The transposition date of the Directive is 25 October 2013. Under Article 6 of the Directive Member States are required to designate one or more National Contact Points (NCPs) to provide patients with ‘appropriate information on all essential aspects of cross-border healthcare [that] is necessary in order to enable [them] to exercise their rights on cross-border healthcare in practice.’</p>
      <p class="normal">This action seeks to design and roll-out a prospective study aiming to assess how NCPs can best formulate and present information to patients. The assessment criteria to be used will address patient satisfaction, information retention and information understanding, notably consistency in patient choices. Research hypotheses will be formulated and relevant literature will be screened. A preliminary study design distinguishing primary/secondary outcomes to be measured in randomised patient groups will be drafted. The results of this study are to be translated into recommendations for Member States.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action will contribute to patient empowerment by increasing clarity on patients’ rights as regards cross-border treatment; patient safety by providing information on healthcare providers, and on the quality and safety standards of the healthcare they provide; and by enhancing Member States’ cooperation on cross-border healthcare through the network of national contact points that will exchange information.</p>

      <p class="normal">The objectives of this action are to provide a platform for Member States to work together on forecasting health workforce needs and workforce planning methodologies and to find possible solutions to the shortage of the health workforce in Europe. This action was announced in Commission Communication COM(2010) 0682 final of 23 November 2010<span class="italic">An Agenda for new skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment</span>

      <p class="normal">Comprehensive and integrated forecasting mechanisms and strategies would help Member States to assess the number and kind of health workforce their health systems require. Adequate forecasting and planning contributes to ensuring the sustainability of health systems and meeting current and future challenges. These include an ageing workforce and ageing patients; increased services to manage chronic conditions, mental health, long-term care and social care; new patterns of health workforce and the growing migration of health workers across countries. Action at EU level can also add value in mapping the skills and competences needed for the future and helping to equip health workers with the necessary education, as well as determining crucial factors for a satisfactory working environment.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action aims to: (a) provide information and exchange best practices about planning methodologies in use. It will provide analyses on the factors determining their success, including the local context, culture and workforce structure. A database of best practices and guidelines for improved modelling will be developed (2013-2014) and an EU-level permanent platform will be created (2015); (b) estimate future needs in terms of skills and competences of the health workforce and their distribution. A report on the different methodologies used in the EU will be produced, together with user's guidelines on how to estimate future needs (2013); (c) advise on how workforce-planning capacities can be built up in Member States (2014). This action will identify experts on workforce planning in Member States that can assist competent authorities in other Member States to build up workforce planning capacities; (d) develop EU guidance on how donor and receiving countries can cooperate in order to find a mutually beneficial solution in terms of training capacities and circular mobility (2014-2015); and (e) provide information on mobility trends of health professionals in Member States (2013-2015). Such collaboration has been initiated within different research and innovation projects, like ‘HEALTH PROfessional Mobility in THe European Union Study’ (PROMeTHEUS)<a id="ntc30-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0030" href="#ntr30-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0030"> (<span class="super">30</span>)</a> or ‘Nurse Forecasting: Human Resources Planning in Nursing’ (RN4CAST)<a id="ntc31-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0031" href="#ntr31-C_2011358EN.01001101-E0031"> (<span class="super">31</span>)</a>, but it needs to be further supported.

Alcoholic beverage labels are increasingly used in the EU, mainly on a voluntary basis by alcohol producers. However, there is not adequate information on the extent of these practices or on their effectiveness in terms of visibility and information value. Previous summaries of voluntary labelling schemes have relied on information gathered through surveys. Research towards a comprehensive picture involves fieldwork to gather representative samples of alcoholic beverage packages from retail outlets across the Member States to assess the effectiveness of health-related information. With regard to curbing underage drinking, legal age limits for selling and serving alcoholic beverages are amongst the most effective instruments. Previous work on best practices in increasing compliance with age limits has mainly focussed on initiatives of NGOs or operators in the alcoholic beverage sector. However, in order to have a comprehensive picture, experiences from initiatives involving local or national authorities should also be taken into account, especially as research findings suggest that results may be best achieved through multi-stakeholder cooperation. Examples of good practices will be collected and the exchange and dissemination of good practices will be facilitated.

      <p class="normal">Rare disease registries and information networks are key instruments for increasing knowledge about rare diseases and developing clinical research. They are the only way to pool data in order to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological research and/or clinical research. Owing to the small size of samples at national level, these registers and information networks can only be created at EU level. Collaborative efforts to establish data collection and maintain them will be considered, provided that these resources are open and accessible. Registration of patients is a key to any further action to improve their quality of life. It is necessary for the designation of orphan drugs, for establishing research priorities and for the designation and accreditation of European Reference Networks (ERN) for rare diseases. This action will also contribute to the reflection on criteria for designating ERN in the framework established by Directive 2011/24/EU. Priority areas for this action are rare tumours, rare anaemias, cerebral palsies, neuromuscular diseases, cystic fibrosis, rare neurological disorders and rare syndromes associated with autism. Other rare diseases may also be considered. This action seeks to co-finance at least five networks.</p>

It will develop a typology of the breadth and depth of health promotion and prevention interventions with a particular focus on alcohol abuse, smoking, nutrition and physical activity. It will include evaluating the performance of these interventions in the light of the OECD Health Data on non-medical determinants of health — nutrition, alcohol abuse and smoking — under the aspect of how this could influence chronic diseases and their economic impact. It will gauge the quality of primary care systems for meeting the needs of people with chronic health conditions by considering their performance in the light of selected population-based quality measures.

      <p class="normal">The objective of this action is to obtain an expert facility to provide advice, at the request of Member States and the Commission, on the efficiency and effectiveness of health systems. The Council conclusions of 6 June 2011<span class="italic">Towards modern, responsive and sustainable health systems</span> call for the Commission to set up a mechanism to this end. This will be accomplished by creating a multi-disciplinary facility consisting of highly qualified experts in relevant fields including public health, health system management, epidemiology, social security, health economics and public finance. Experts should come from academia, industry and civil society. The Commission will manage the facility. This will include, where necessary, preparing background material to be attached to questions and liaising with the experts. The opinions endorsed by the experts must be tailored to the specific needs and the specific situation of the Member State submitting the request. This facility may also provide health expertise to the Commission in connection with the Annual Growth Survey and the national reform plans. This action covers the indemnities paid to experts for their work.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">The objective of this action is to give EU citizens accurate and timely information on EU public health activities provided for in Article 168 of the TFEU, and thereby bring Europe closer to citizens. This action also seeks to promote EU health-related actions linked to new priorities, including the <span class="italic">Europe 2020 Strategy</span>.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action has three components. The first of these is the promotion of Directive 2011/24/EU. The Directive provides for a new and innovative approach to addressing reimbursement of cross-border healthcare, facilitates the recognition of prescriptions from other Member States, helps patients requiring specialised treatment, and facilitates the exchange of information on the quality and safety standards of healthcare. The success of its implementation depends on how well informed stakeholders and the general public are of its provisions. Clear and targeted measures under this action seek to ensure this. Measures include leaflets, disseminating information on the web, and participation in conferences with stakeholders.</p>
      <p class="normal">The second component is organising the Fourth EU Journalist Prize. This action seeks to further expand and maintain an informal network of journalists in Member States focusing on health. This will contribute to a better EU health news coverage in Member States and thereby increasing awareness of EU action on health, healthcare and patients’ rights.</p>
      <p class="normal">The third component covers the preparation and dissemination of information and communication material to explain EU health activities and initiatives. In addition to activities relating to on-going health initiatives and promoting health programmes’ results, activities focus in particular on explaining the <span class="italic">Tobacco Products’ Initiative</span> and the <span class="italic">Health Security Initiative</span> to stakeholders and citizens. Activities include preparing and disseminating audiovisual material and publications in electronic format and on paper, organising and participating in workshops and expert meetings, and providing information stands and other communication/PR material.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="normal">The objective of the measures covered by this action is to support EU public health policies as set out in Article 168 of the TFEU through relevant IT applications. These IT tools also support the <span class="italic">Europe 2020 Strategy</span>, namely refocusing innovation on the challenges facing our society in the area of health, promoting e-health, reducing health inequalities, promoting active and healthy ageing, addressing new risks for health, and ensuring better access to health care systems.</p>

It will help to increase the sustainability of projects funded by the health programme, by maintaining and building on the information and data produced so far. Provision of health evidence and reporting at EU level makes it possible to compare policies supporting policy development and evaluation and helping to identify, disseminate and apply best practices. This enables the EU and Member States to detect health-related obstacles to growth and thereby better support national health systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">This action has three components. The first component consists of gathering, analysing and disseminating comparable evidence-based data and information to support and evaluate health policies, and providing information to European policy-makers, experts, and citizens.</p>
