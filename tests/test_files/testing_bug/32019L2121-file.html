The rules on cross-border mergers represent a significant milestone in improving the functioning of the internal market for companies and firms and their exercise of the freedom of establishment. However, evaluation of those rules shows that they need to be changed. Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide for rules regulating cross-border conversions and divisions, since Directive (EU) 2017/1132 only provides for rules on domestic divisions of public limited liability companies.</p>

Under the second paragraph of Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’), when read in conjunction with Article 54 of the TFEU, the freedom of establishment for companies or firms includes, inter alia, the right to form and manage such companies or firms under the conditions laid down by the legislation of the Member State of establishment. This has been interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union as encompassing the right of a company or firm formed in accordance with the legislation of a Member State to convert itself into a company or firm governed by the law of another Member State, provided that the conditions laid down by the legislation of that other Member State are satisfied and, in particular, that the test adopted by the latter Member State to determine the connection of a company or firm with its national legal order is satisfied.</p>

Article 54 of the TFEU places the connecting factors of the registered office, the central administration and the principal place of business of a company or firm on an equal footing. Therefore, as clarified in case-law, the fact that only the registered office, and not the central administration or principal place of business, is transferred does not as such exclude the applicability of the freedom of establishment under Article 49 of the TFEU.</p>

The rights of companies to convert, merge and divide across borders should go hand in hand, and be properly balanced, with the protection of employees, creditors and members.</p>

The possibility of forming a company through a division by separation as provided for in this Directive offers companies a new harmonised procedure in the internal market.
