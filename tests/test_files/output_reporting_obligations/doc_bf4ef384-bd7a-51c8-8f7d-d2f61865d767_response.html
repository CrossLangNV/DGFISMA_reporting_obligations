The contributions should be calculated at the highest level of consolidation of those entities within the participating Member States , since all subsidiaries of a group inside the perimeter of consolidation fall within the scope of the decision - making powers of the Board when adopting group resolution plans , carrying out the assessment of resolvability of groups and adopting resolution decisions for groups . The exercise of those tasks implies expenditures for the Board for collecting and analysing information and data related to each subsidiary included in the perimeter of consolidation . Since those are expenditures related to the services provided by the Board to the entities that are subjected to the Single Resolution Mechanism , they should be paid by those entities and therefore the administrative contributions should be calculated on the basis of their consolidated accounts at the highest level of consolidation within the participating Member States and only one contribution per group should be calculated .</p>

Any duplication of the data reporting and verification processes would inevitably require more time for the calculation and raising of contributions and would lead to a less efficient system . It follows that , as a part of the cooperation obligation , the ECB should be required to transmit to the Board the data received from the institutions and entities concerned for the purpose of calculating contributions to the Board . The Board should rely to the greatest extent possible on the data collected by the ECB .</p>
