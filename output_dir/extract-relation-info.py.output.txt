==========================================================
(k) the instruments entitle their owners to a claim on the residual assets of the institution, which, in the event of its liquidation and after the payment of all senior claims, is proportionate to the amount of such instruments issued and is not fixed or subject to a cap, except in the case of the capital instruments referred to in Article 27;
==========================================================
(l) the instruments are not secured, or subject to a guarantee that enhances the seniority of the claim by any of the following

By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, when an institution hedges a non-trading book credit risk exposure or counterparty risk exposure using a credit derivative booked in its trading book using an internal hedge, the non-trading book exposure or counterparty risk exposure shall not be deemed to be hedged for the purposes of calculating risk weighted exposure amounts unless the institution purchases from an eligible third party protection provider a corresponding credit derivative meeting the requirements for unfunded credit protection in the non-trading book. Without prejudice to point (h) of Article 299(2), where such third party protection is purchased and recognised as a hedge of a non-trading book exposure for the purposes of calculating capital requirements, neither the internal nor external credit derivative hedge shall be included in the trading book for the purposes of calculating capital requirements.

==========================================================
1. Institutions shall apply either the Standardised Approach provided for in Chapter 2 or, if permitted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 143, the Internal Ratings Based Approach provided for in Chapter 3 to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of points (a) and (f) of Article 92(3).
==========================================================
2. For trade exposures and for default fund contributions to a central counterparty, institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Chapter 6, Section 9 to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of points (a) and (f) of Article 92(3). For all other types of exposures to a central counterparty, institutions shall treat those exposures as described in the following list 
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of this Regulation, exposures to third-country investment firms and exposures to third country credit institutions and exposures to third country clearing houses and exchanges shall be treated as exposures to an institution only if the third country applies prudential and supervisory requirements to that entity that are at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.
==========================================================
4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may continue to treat exposures to the entities referred to in paragraph 3 as exposures to institutions provided that the relevant competent authorities had approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014.
==========================================================
Article 108 : Use of credit risk mitigation technique under the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. For an exposure to which an institution applies the Standardised Approach under Chapter 2 or applies the IRB Approach under Chapter 3 but without using its own estimates of loss given default (LGD) and conversion factors under Article 151, the institution may use credit risk mitigation in accordance with Chapter 4 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of points (a) and (f) of Article 92(3) or, as relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in point (d) of Article 36(1) and point (c) of Article 62.
==========================================================
2. For an exposure to which an institution applies the IRB Approach by using their own estimates of LGD and conversion factors under Article 151, the institution may use credit risk mitigation in accordance with Chapter 3.
==========================================================
Article 109 : Treatment of securitised exposures under the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. Where an institution uses the Standardised Approach under Chapter 2 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the exposure class to which the securitised exposures would be assigned under Article 112, it shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for a securitisation position in accordance with Articles 245, 246 and 251 to 258. Institutions using the Standardised Approach may also use the Internal Assessment Approach where this has been permitted under Article 259(3).
==========================================================
2. Where an institution uses the IRB Approach under Chapter 3 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposures amounts for the exposure class to which the securitised exposure would be assigned under Article 147 it shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with Articles 245, 246 and 259 to 266.
==========================================================
Except for the Internal Assessment Approach, where the IRB Approach is used only for a part of the securitised exposures underlying a securitisation, the institution shall use the approach corresponding to the predominant share of securitised exposures underlying this securitisation.

==========================================================
3. Institutions using the IRB Approach that apply the Standardised Approach for a part of their exposures on consolidated or individual basis, in accordance with Articles 148 and 150 shall determine the part of general credit risk adjustment that shall be assigned to the treatment of general credit risk adjustment under the Standardised Approach and to the treatment of general credit risk adjustment under the IRB Approach as described in the following list 
==========================================================
where applicable when an institution included in the consolidation exclusively applies the IRB Approach, general credit risk adjustments of this institution shall be assigned to the treatment set out in paragraph 2
==========================================================
where applicable, when an institution included in the consolidation exclusively applies the Standardised Approach, general credit risk adjustment of this institution shall be assigned to the treatment set out in paragraph 1
==========================================================
The remainder of credit risk adjustment shall be assigned on a pro rata basis according to the proportion of risk weighted exposure amounts subject to the Standardised Approach and subject to the IRB Approach

Article 113 : Calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
1. To calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, risk weights shall be applied to all exposures, unless deducted from own funds, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2. The application of risk weights shall be based on the exposure class to which the exposure is assigned and, to the extent specified in Section 2, its credit quality. Credit quality may be determined by reference to the credit assessments of ECAIs or the credit assessments of Export Credit Agencies in accordance with Section 3.

3. Institutions may determine the risk weight for a CIU in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5, if the following eligibility criteria are met 
==========================================================
For the purposes of point (a), the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in this paragraph to exposures in the form of units or shares of CIUs from third countries where the relevant competent authorities had approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014.
==========================================================
4. Where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to calculate an average risk weight for its exposures in the form of units or shares in the CIUs in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter. Where an underlying exposure of the CIU is itself an exposure in the form of shares in another CIU which fulfils the criteria of paragraph 3, the institution may look through to the underlying exposures of that other CIU.
==========================================================
5. Where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may calculate an average risk weight for its exposures in the form of a unit or share in the CIU in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter subject to the assumption that the CIU first invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in the exposure classes attracting the highest capital requirement, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached.
==========================================================
Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report, in accordance with the methods set out in paragraphs 4 and 5, a risk weight for the CIU 
==========================================================
SUBJ: the following third parties ❮the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the ciu provided that the ciu exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or the financial institution ‖ for cius not covered by point (a), the ciu management company, provided that the ciu management company meets the criteria set out in paragraph 3(a)❯

Article 133 : Equity exposures
==========================================================
1. The following exposures shall be considered equity exposures 
==========================================================
2. Equity exposures shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %, unless they are required to be deducted in accordance with Part Two, assigned a 250 % risk weight in accordance with Article 48(4), assigned a 1 250 % risk weight in accordance with Article 89(3) or treated as high risk items in accordance with Article 128.
==========================================================
3. Investments in equity or regulatory capital instruments issued by institutions shall be classified as equity claims, unless deducted from own funds or attracting a 250 % risk weight under Article 48(4) or treated as high risk items in accordance with Article 128.
==========================================================
Article 134 : Other items
==========================================================
1. Tangible assets within the meaning of Article 4(10) of Directive 86/635/EEC shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.
==========================================================
2. Prepayments and accrued income for which an institution is unable to determine the counterparty in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC, shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.
==========================================================
3. Cash items in the process of collection shall be assigned a 20 % risk weight. Cash in hand and equivalent cash items shall be assigned a 0 % risk weight.
==========================================================
4. Gold bullion held in own vaults or on an allocated basis to the extent backed by bullion liabilities shall be assigned a 0 % risk weight.
==========================================================
5. In the case of asset sale and repurchase agreements and outright forward purchases, the risk weight shall be that assigned to the assets in question and not to the counterparties to the transactions.
==========================================================
6. Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, and where the product has an external credit assessment from an ECAI, the risk weights prescribed in Chapter 5 shall be assigned. If the product is not rated by an ECAI, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, up to a maximum of 1 250 % and multiplied by the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative to obtain the risk weighted asset amount. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation.
==========================================================
7. The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments are the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option the exercise of which is reasonably certain. A party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased property and that payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Articles 213 to 215, that payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection under Chapter 4. These exposures shall be assigned to the relevant exposure class in accordance with Article 112. When the exposure is a residual value of leased assets, the risk weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated as follows: 1/t * 100 % * residual value, where t is the greater of 1 and the nearest number of whole years of the lease remaining.

==========================================================
2. When determining the mapping of credit assessments, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall comply with the following requirements .
==========================================================
in order to differentiate between the relative degrees of risk expressed by each credit assessment, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall consider quantitative factors such as the long-term default rate associated with all items assigned the same credit assessment. For recently established ECAIs and for those that have compiled only a short record of default data, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall ask the ECAI what it believes to be the long-term default rate associated with all items assigned the same credit assessment.
==========================================================
in order to differentiate between the relative degrees of risk expressed by each credit assessment, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall consider qualitative factors such as the pool of issuers that the ECAI covers, the range of credit assessments that the ECAI assigns, each credit assessment meaning and the ECAI's definition of default.
==========================================================
EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall compare default rates experienced for each credit assessment of a particular ECAI and compare them with a benchmark built on the basis of default rates experienced by other ECAIs on a population of issuers that present an equivalent level of credit risk.
==========================================================
where the default rates experienced for the credit assessment of a particular ECAI are materially and systematically higher then the benchmark, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall assign a higher credit quality step in the credit quality assessment scale to the ECAI credit assessment.
==========================================================
where EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have increased the associated risk weight for a specific credit assessment of a particular ECAI, and where default rates experienced for that ECAI's credit assessment are no longer materially and systematically higher than the benchmark, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA may restore the original credit quality step in the credit quality assessment scale for the ECAI credit assessment.
==========================================================
3. EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the quantitative factors referred to in point (a), the qualitative factors referred to in point (b) and the benchmark referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2.

==========================================================
it is a consensus risk score from Export Credit Agencies participating in the OECD "Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits"
==========================================================
the Export Credit Agency publishes its credit assessments, and the Export Credit Agency subscribes to the OECD agreed methodology, and the credit assessment is associated with one of the eight minimum export insurance premiums that the OECD agreed methodology establishes. An institution may revoke its nomination of an Export Credit Agency. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements

Section 4 : Use of the ecai credit assessments for the determination of risk weights
==========================================================
Article 138 : General requirements
==========================================================
An institution may nominate one or more ECAIs to be used for the determination of risk weights to be assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items. An institution may revoke its nomination of an ECAI. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements. Credit assessments shall not be used selectively. An institution shall use solicited credit assessments. However it may use unsolicited credit assessments if EBA has confirmed that unsolicited credit assessments of an ECAI do not differ in quality from solicited credit assessments of this ECAI. EBA shall refuse or revoke this confirmation in particular if the ECAI has used an unsolicited credit assessment to put pressure on the rated entity to place an order for a credit assessment or other services. In using credit assessment, institutions shall comply with the following requirements .
==========================================================
an institution which decides to use the credit assessments produced by an ECAI for a certain class of items shall use those credit assessments consistently for all exposures belonging to that class.
==========================================================
an institution which decides to use the credit assessments produced by an ECAI shall use them in a continuous and consistent way over time.
==========================================================
an institution shall only use ECAIs credit assessments that take into account all amounts both in principal and in interest owed to it.
==========================================================
where only one credit assessment is available from a nominated ECAI for a rated item, that credit assessment shall be used to determine the risk weight for that item.
==========================================================
where two credit assessments are available from nominated ECAIs and the two correspond to different risk weights for a rated item, the higher risk weight shall be assigned.
==========================================================
where more than two credit assessments are available from nominated ECAIs for a rated item, the two assessments generating the two lowest risk weights shall be referred to. If the two lowest risk weights are different, the higher risk weight shall be assigned. If the two lowest risk weights are the same, that risk weight shall be assigned.
==========================================================
Article 139 : Issuer and issue credit assessment
==========================================================
1. Where a credit assessment exists for a specific issuing programme or facility to which the item constituting the exposure belongs, this credit assessment shall be used to determine the risk weight to be assigned to that item.
==========================================================
2. Where no directly applicable credit assessment exists for a certain item, but a credit assessment exists for a specific issuing programme or facility to which the item constituting the exposure does not belong or a general credit assessment exists for the issuer, then that credit assessment shall be used in either of the following cases 
==========================================================
In all other cases, the exposure shall be treated as unrated.
==========================================================
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are not to prevent the application of Article 129.
==========================================================
4. Credit assessments for issuers within a corporate group cannot be used as credit assessment of another issuer within the same corporate group.
==========================================================
Article 140 : Long-term and short-term credit assessments
==========================================================
1. Short-term credit assessments may only be used for short-term asset and off-balance sheet items constituting exposures to institutions and corporates.
==========================================================
2. Any short-term credit assessment shall only apply to the item the short-term credit assessment refers to, and it shall not be used to derive risk weights for any other item, except in the following cases 
==========================================================
if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 150 % risk weight, then all unrated unsecured exposures on that obligor whether short-term or long-term shall also be assigned a 150 % risk weight
==========================================================
if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 50 % risk-weight, no unrated short-term exposure shall be assigned a risk weight lower than 100 %
==========================================================
Article 141 : Domestic and foreign currency items
==========================================================
A credit assessment that refers to an item denominated in the obligor's domestic currency cannot be used to derive a risk weight for another exposure on that same obligor that is denominated in a foreign currency.
==========================================================
When an exposure arises through an institution's participation in a loan that has been extended by a multilateral development bank whose preferred creditor status is recognised in the market, the credit assessment on the obligors' domestic currency item may be used for risk weighting purposes.

==========================================================
Subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, implementation may be carried out sequentially across the different exposure classes, referred to in Article 147, within the same business unit, across different business units in the same group or for the use of own estimates of LGDs or conversion factors for the calculation of risk weights for exposures to corporates, institutions, and central governments and central banks.
==========================================================
In the case of the retail exposure class referred to in Article 147(5), implementation may be carried out sequentially across the categories of exposures to which the different correlations in Article 154 correspond.
==========================================================
2. Competent authorities shall determine the time period over which an institution and any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries shall be required to implement the IRB Approach for all exposures. This time period shall be one that competent authorities consider to be appropriate on the basis of the nature and scale of the activities of the institutions, or any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries, and the number and nature of rating systems to be implemented.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall carry out implementation of the IRB Approach according to conditions determined by the competent authorities. The competent authority shall design those conditions such that they ensure that the flexibility under paragraph 1 is not used selectively for the purposes of achieving reduced own funds requirements in respect of those exposure classes or business units that are yet to be included in the IRB Approach or in the use of own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors.
==========================================================
4. Institutions that have begun to use the IRB Approach only after 1 January 2013 or have until that date been required by the competent authorities to be able to calculate their capital requirements using the Standardised Approach shall retain their ability to calculate capital requirements using the Standardised Approach for all their exposures during the implementation period until the competent authorities notify them that they are satisfied that the implementation of the IRB Approach will be completed with reasonable certainty.

==========================================================
1. Where exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs meet the criteria set out in Article 132(3) and the institution is aware of all or parts of the underlying exposures of the CIU, the institution shall look through to those underlying exposures in order to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter.
==========================================================
Where an underlying exposure of the CIU is itself another exposure in the form of units or shares in another CIU, the first institution shall also look through to the underlying exposures of the other CIU.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
==========================================================
Sub-Section 2 : Calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for credit risk
==========================================================
Article 153 : Risk weighted exposure amounts for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks
==========================================================
1. Subject to the application of the specific treatments laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, the risk weighted exposure amounts for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks shall be calculated according to the following formulae:
==========================================================
where the risk weight RW is defined as
==========================================================
(i) if PD = 0, RW shall be 0;
==========================================================
(ii) if PD = 1, i.e., for defaulted exposures where institutions apply the LGD values set out in Article 161(1), RW shall be 0.
==========================================================
(ii) if PD = 1, i.e., for defaulted exposures where institutions use own estimates of LGDs, RW shall be.
==========================================================
where the expected loss best estimate (hereinafter referred to as "ELBE") shall be the institution's best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1)(h);
==========================================================
(iii) if 0 < PD < 1
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
N(x) = the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable (i.e. the probability that a normal random variable with mean zero and variance of one is less than or equal to x);
==========================================================
G(Z) = denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable (i.e. the value x such that N(x) = z)
==========================================================
R = denotes the coefficient of correlation, is defined as
==========================================================
b = the maturity adjustment factor, which is defined as
==========================================================
.
==========================================================
2. For all exposures to large financial sector entities, the co-efficient of correlation of paragraph 1(iii) is multiplied by 1,25. For all exposures to unregulated financial entities, the coefficients of correlation set out in paragraph 1(iii) and paragraph 4, as relevant, are multiplied by 1,25.
==========================================================
3. The risk weighted exposure amount for each exposure which meets the requirements set out in Articles 202 and 217 may be adjusted according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
PDpp = PD of the protection provider.
==========================================================
RW shall be calculated using the relevant risk weight formula set out in point 1 for the exposure, the PD of the obligor and the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. The maturity factor (b) shall be calculated using the lower of the PD of the protection provider and the PD of the obligor.
==========================================================
4. For exposures to companies where the total annual sales for the consolidated group of which the firm is a part is less than EUR 50 million, institutions may use the following correlation formula in paragraph 1 (iii) for the calculation of risk weights for corporate exposures. In this formula S is expressed as total annual sales in millions of Euros with EUR 5 million ≤ S ≤ EUR 50 million. Reported sales of less than EUR 5 million shall be treated as if they were equivalent to EUR 5 million. For purchased receivables the total annual sales shall be the weighted average by individual exposures of the pool.
==========================================================
Institutions shall substitute total assets of the consolidated group for total annual sales when total annual sales are not a meaningful indicator of firm size and total assets are a more meaningful indicator than total annual sales.
==========================================================
5. For specialised lending exposures in respect of which an institution is not able to estimate PDs or the institutions' PD estimates do not meet the requirements set out in Section 6, the institution shall assign risk weights to these exposures according to Table 1, as follows:
==========================================================
Table 1
==========================================================
Remaining Maturity Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Category 4 Category 5
==========================================================
Less than 2,5 years 50 % 70 % 115 % 250 % 0 %
==========================================================
Equal or more than 2,5 years 70 % 90 % 115 % 250 % 0 %
==========================================================
In assigning risk weights to specialised lending exposures institutions shall take into account the following factors: financial strength, political and legal environment, transaction and/or asset characteristics, strength of the sponsor and developer, including any public private partnership income stream, and security package.
==========================================================
6. For their purchased corporate receivables institutions shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184. For purchased corporate receivables that comply in addition with the conditions set out in Article 154(5), and where it would be unduly burdensome for an institution to use the risk quantification standards for corporate exposures as set out in Section 6 for these receivables, the risk quantification standards for retail exposures as set out in Section 6 may be used.
==========================================================
7. For purchased corporate receivables, refundable purchase discounts, collateral or partial guarantees that provide first-loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as first-loss positions under the IRB securitisation framework.
==========================================================
8. Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, if the product has an external credit assessment from an ECAI the risk weights set out in Chapter 5 shall be applied. If the product is not rated by an ECAI, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures where the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative multiplied by 12,5. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation. A 1 250 % risk weight shall apply to positions in a basket for which an institution cannot determine the risk-weight under the IRB Approach.
==========================================================
9. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions shall take into account the factors referred to the second subparagraph of paragraph 5 when assigning risk weights to specialised lending exposures.
==========================================================
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.

Article 154 : Risk weighted exposure amounts for retail exposures
==========================================================
1. The risk-weighted exposure amounts for retail exposures shall be calculated according to the following formulae:
==========================================================
where the risk weight RW is defined as described in the following list 
==========================================================
if PD = 1, i.e., for defaulted exposures, RW shall be

;
==========================================================
where ELBE shall be the institution's best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1)(h);

(ii) if 0 < PD < 1, i.e., for any possible value for PD other than under (i)
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
N(x) = the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable (i.e. the probability that a normal random variable with mean zero and variance of one is less than or equal to x);

R = the coefficient of correlation defined as
==========================================================
2. The risk weighted exposure amount for each exposure to an SME as referred to in Article 147(5) which meets the requirements set out in Articles 202 and 217 may be calculated in accordance with Article 153(3).
==========================================================
3. For retail exposures secured by immovable property collateral a coefficient of correlation R of 0,15 shall replace the figure produced by the correlation formula in paragraph 1.
==========================================================
4. For qualifying revolving retail exposures in accordance with points (a) to (e), a coefficient of correlation R of 0,04 shall replace the figure produced by the correlation formula in paragraph 1.
==========================================================
Exposures shall qualify as qualifying revolving retail exposures if they meet the following conditions 
==========================================================
the exposures are to individuals
==========================================================
the exposures are revolving, unsecured, and to the extent they are not drawn immediately and unconditionally, cancellable by the institution. In this context revolving exposures are defined as those where customers' outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay, up to a limit established by the institution. Undrawn commitments may be considered as unconditionally cancellable if the terms permit the institution to cancel them to the full extent allowable under consumer protection and related legislation
==========================================================
the maximum exposure to a single individual in the sub-portfolio is EUR 100 000 or less
==========================================================
the use of the correlation of this paragraph is limited to portfolios that have exhibited low volatility of loss rates, relative to their average level of loss rates, especially within the low PD bands
==========================================================
the treatment as a qualifying revolving retail exposure shall be consistent with the underlying risk characteristics of the sub-portfolio
==========================================================
By way of derogation from point (b), the requirement to be unsecured does not apply in respect of collateralised credit facilities linked to a wage account. In this case amounts recovered from the collateral shall not be taken into account in the LGD estimate.
==========================================================
Competent authorities shall review the relative volatility of loss rates across the qualifying revolving retail sub-portfolios, as well the aggregate qualifying revolving retail portfolio, and shall share information on the typical characteristics of qualifying revolving retail loss rates across Member States.

5. To be eligible for the retail treatment, purchased receivables shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184 and the following conditions 
==========================================================
the institution has purchased the receivables from unrelated, third party sellers, and its exposure to the obligor of the receivable does not include any exposures that are directly or indirectly originated by the institution itself
==========================================================
the purchased receivables shall be generated on an arm's-length basis between the seller and the obligor. As such, inter-company accounts receivables and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible
==========================================================
the purchasing institution has a claim on all proceeds from the purchased receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds
==========================================================
the portfolio of purchased receivables is sufficiently diversified
==========================================================
6. For purchased receivables, refundable purchase discounts, collateral or partial guarantees that provide first-loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as first-loss positions under the IRB securitisation framework.
==========================================================
7. For hybrid pools of purchased retail receivables where purchasing institutions cannot separate exposures secured by immovable property collateral and qualifying revolving retail exposures from other retail exposures, the retail risk weight function producing the highest capital requirements for those exposures shall apply.
==========================================================
Article 155 : Risk weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall determine their risk-weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures, excluding those deducted in accordance with Part Two or subject to a 250 % risk weight in accordance with Article 48, in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. An institution may apply different approaches to different equity portfolios where the institution itself uses different approaches for internal risk management purposes. Where an institution uses different approaches, the choice of the PD / LGD approach or the internal models approach shall be made consistently, including over time and with the approach used for the internal risk management of the relevant equity exposure, and shall not be determined by regulatory arbitrage considerations.
==========================================================
Institutions may treat equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings according to the treatment of other non credit- obligation assets.
==========================================================
2. Under the Simple risk weight approach, the risk weighted exposure amount shall be calculated according to the formula:
==========================================================
,
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
Risk weight (RW)= 190 % for private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios.
==========================================================
Risk weight (RW)= 290 % for exchange traded equity exposures.
==========================================================
Risk weight (RW)= 370 % for all other equity exposures.
==========================================================
Short cash positions and derivative instruments held in the non-trading book are permitted to offset long positions in the same individual stocks provided that these instruments have been explicitly designated as hedges of specific equity exposures and that they provide a hedge for at least another year. Other short positions are to be treated as if they are long positions with the relevant risk weight assigned to the absolute value of each position. In the context of maturity mismatched positions, the method is that for corporate exposures as set out in Article 162(5).
==========================================================
Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4.
==========================================================
3. Under the PD/LGD approach, risk weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated according to the formulas in Article 153(1). If institutions do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights.
==========================================================
At the individual exposure level the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the exposure value multiplied by 12,5.
==========================================================
Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. This shall be subject to an LGD of 90 % on the exposure to the provider of the hedge. For private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios an LGD of 65 % may be used. For these purposes M shall be five years.
==========================================================
4. Under the internal models approach, the risk weighted exposure amount shall be the potential loss on the institution's equity exposures as derived using internal value-at-risk models subject to the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval of the difference between quarterly returns and an appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long-term sample period, multiplied by 12,5. The risk weighted exposure amounts at the equity portfolio level shall not be less than the total of the sums of the following 
==========================================================
The amounts referred to in point (a) and (b) shall be calculated on the basis of the PD values set out in Article 165(1) and the corresponding LGD values set out in Article 165(2).
==========================================================
Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity position.
==========================================================

,
==========================================================
except for cash in hand and equivalent cash items as well as gold bullion held in own vault or on an allocated basis to the extent backed by bullion liabilities, in which case a 0 % risk-weight shall be assigned.

except for when the exposure is a residual value of leased assets in which case it shall be calculated as described in the following list 
==========================================================
Sub-Section 3 : Calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for dilution risk of purchased receivables

==========================================================
2. Institutions shall determine the input parameters PD and LGD in accordance with Section 4.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall determine the exposure value in accordance with Section 5.
==========================================================
4. For the purposes of this Article, the value of M is 1 year.
==========================================================
5. The competent authorities shall exempt an institution from calculating and recognising risk weighted exposure amounts for dilution risk of a type of exposures caused by purchased corporate or retail receivables where the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that dilution risk for that institution is immaterial for this type of exposures.

==========================================================
2. The expected loss amounts for securitised exposures shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5.
==========================================================
3. The expected loss amount for exposures belonging to the "other non credit obligations assets" exposure class referred to in point (g) of Article 147(2) shall be zero.
==========================================================
4. The expected loss amounts for exposures in the form of shares or units of a CIU referred to in Article 152 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods set out in this Article.
==========================================================
5. The expected loss (EL) and expected loss amounts for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and retail exposures shall be calculated according to the following formulae:
==========================================================
Expected loss amount = EL [multiplied by] exposure value.
==========================================================
For defaulted exposures (PD = 100 %) where institutions use own estimates of LGDs, EL shall be ELBE, the institution's best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1)(h).
==========================================================
For exposures subject to the treatment set out in Article 153(3), EL shall be 0 %.

7. The expected loss amounts for equity exposures where the risk weighted exposure amounts are calculated according to simple risk weight approach shall be calculated according to the following formula:
==========================================================
The EL values shall be the following:
==========================================================
Expected loss (EL)= 0,8 % for private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios
==========================================================
Expected loss (EL)= 0,8 % for exchange traded equity exposures
==========================================================
Expected loss (EL)= 2,4 % for all other equity exposures.
==========================================================
8. The expected loss and expected loss amounts for equity exposures where the risk weighted exposure amounts are calculated according to the PD/LGD approach shall be calculated according to the following formulae:
==========================================================
9. The expected loss amounts for equity exposures where the risk weighted exposure amounts are calculated according to the internal models approach shall be zero.
==========================================================
10. The expected loss amounts for dilution risk of purchased receivables shall be calculated according to the following formula:
==========================================================
Article 159 : Treatment of expected loss amounts
==========================================================
Institutions shall subtract the expected loss amounts calculated in accordance with Article 158 (5), (6) and (10) from the general and specific credit risk adjustments and additional value adjustments in accordance with Articles 34 and 110 and other own funds reductions related to these exposures. Discounts on balance sheet exposures purchased when in default in accordance with Article 166(1) shall be treated in the same manner as specific credit risk adjustments. Specific credit risk adjustments on exposures in default shall not be used to cover expected loss amounts on other exposures. Expected loss amounts for securitised exposures and general and specific credit risk adjustments related to these exposures shall not be included in this calculation.

==========================================================
Article 160 : Probability of default (PD)
==========================================================
1. The PD of an exposure to a corporate or an institution shall be at least 0,03 %.
==========================================================
2. For purchased corporate receivables in respect of which an institution is not able to estimate PDs or institution's PD estimates do not meet the requirements set out in Section 6, the PDs for these exposures shall be determined according to the following methods 
==========================================================
for senior claims on purchased corporate receivables PD shall be the institutions estimate of EL divided by LGD for these receivables
==========================================================
for subordinated claims on purchased corporate receivables PD shall be the institution's estimate of EL
==========================================================
an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures pursuant to Article 143 and that can decompose its EL estimates for purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner that the competent authority considers to be reliable, may use the PD estimate that results from this decomposition
==========================================================
3. The PD of obligors in default shall be 100 %.
==========================================================
4. Institutions may take into account unfunded credit protection in the PD in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4. For dilution risk, in addition to the protection providers referred to in Article 201(1)(g) the seller of the purchased receivables is eligible if the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
5. Institutions using own LGD estimates may recognise unfunded credit protection by adjusting PDs subject to Article 161(3).
==========================================================
6. For dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables, PD shall be set equal to the EL estimate of the institution for dilution risk. An institution that has received permission from the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures that can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner that the competent authority considers to be reliable, may use the PD estimate that results from this decomposition. Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection in the PD in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4. For dilution risk, in addition to the protection providers referred to in Article 201(1)(g), the seller of the purchased receivables is eligible provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 4 are met.

Article 161 : Loss Given Default (LGD)
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall use the following LGD values 
==========================================================
2. For dilution and default risk if an institution has received permission from the competent authority to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures pursuant to Article 143 and it can decompose its EL estimates for purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner the competent authority considers to be reliable, the LGD estimate for purchased corporate receivables may be used.
==========================================================
3. If an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own LGD estimates for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks pursuant to Article 143, unfunded credit protection may be recognised by adjusting PD or LGD subject to requirements as specified in Section 6 and permission of the competent authorities. An institution shall not assign guaranteed exposures an adjusted PD or LGD such that the adjusted risk weight would be lower than that of a comparable, direct exposure to the guarantor.
==========================================================
4. For the purposes of the undertakings referred to in Article 153(3), the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider shall either be the LGD associated with an unhedged facility to the guarantor or the unhedged facility of the obligor, depending upon whether in the event both the guarantor and obligor default during the life of the hedged transaction, available evidence and the structure of the guarantee indicate that the amount recovered would depend on the financial condition of the guarantor or obligor, respectively.

Article 162 : Maturity
==========================================================
1. Institutions that have not received permission to use own LGDs and own conversion factors for exposures to corporates, institutions or central governments and central banks shall assign to exposures arising from repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions a maturity value (M) of 0,5 years and to all other exposures an M of 2,5 years.
==========================================================
Alternatively, as part of the permission referred to in Article 143, the competent authorities shall decide on whether the institution shall use maturity (M) for each exposure as set out under paragraph 2.
==========================================================
2. Institutions that have received the permission of the competent authority to use own LGDs and own conversion factors for exposures to corporates, institutions or central governments and central banks pursuant to Article 143 shall calculate M for each of these exposures as set out in points (a) to (e) of this paragraph and subject to paragraphs 3 to 5 of this Article. M shall be no greater than five years except in the cases specified in Article 384(1) where M as specified there shall be used 
==========================================================
for an instrument subject to a cash flow schedule, M shall be calculated according to the following formula ❬where CFt denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the obligor in period t❭
==========================================================
for derivatives subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the exposure, where M shall be at least 1 year, and the notional amount of each exposure shall be used for weighting the maturity
==========================================================
for exposures arising from fully or nearly-fully collateralised derivative instruments listed in Annex II and fully or nearly-fully collateralised margin lending transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least 10 days
==========================================================
for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least five days. The notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity
==========================================================
an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own PD estimates for purchased corporate receivables, for drawn amounts M shall equal the purchased receivables exposure weighted average maturity, where M shall be at least 90 days. This same value of M shall also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided the facility contains effective covenants, early amortisation triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing institution against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility's term. Absent such effective protections, M for undrawn amounts shall be calculated as the sum of the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement and the remaining maturity of the purchase facility, where M shall be at least 90 days
==========================================================
for any other instrument than those mentioned in this paragraph or when an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in (a), M shall be the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, where M shall be at least 1 year
==========================================================
for institutions using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6 to calculate the exposure values, M shall be calculated for exposures to which they apply this method and for which the maturity of the longest-dated contract contained in the netting set is greater than one year according to the following formula ❬where: = a dummy variable whose value at future period tk is equal to 0 if tk > 1 year and to 1 if tk ≤ 1; = the expected exposure at the future period tk; = the effective expected exposure at the future period tk; = the risk-free discount factor for future time period tk and/or ❭
==========================================================
an institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) may use, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, the effective credit duration estimated by the internal model as M
==========================================================
Subject to paragraph 2, for netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year the formula in point (a) shall apply;
==========================================================
(i) for institutions using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6, to calculate the exposure values and having an internal model permission for specific risk associated with traded debt positions in accordance with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5, M shall be set to 1 in the formula laid out in Article 153(1), provided that an institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that its internal model for Specific risk associated with traded debt positions applied in Article 383 contains effects of rating migrations;

3. Where the documentation requires daily re-margining and daily revaluation and includes provisions that allow for the prompt liquidation or set off of collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin, M shall be at least one-day for fully or nearly-fully collateralised derivative instruments listed in Annex II.
==========================================================
3. Where the documentation requires daily re-margining and daily revaluation and includes provisions that allow for the prompt liquidation or set off of collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin, M shall be at least one-day for fully or nearly-fully collateralised margin lending transactions.
==========================================================
3. Where the documentation requires daily re-margining and daily revaluation and includes provisions that allow for the prompt liquidation or set off of collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin, M shall be at least one-day for repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions.

In addition, for qualifying short-term exposures which are not part of the institution's ongoing financing of the obligor, M shall be at least one-day. Qualifying short term exposures shall include the following 
==========================================================
4. For exposures to corporates situated in the Union and having consolidated sales and consolidated assets of less than EUR 500 million, institutions may choose to consistently set M as set out in paragraph 1 instead of applying paragraph 2. Institutions may replace EUR 500 million total assets with EUR 1 000 million total assets for corporates which primarily own and let non-speculative residential property.

==========================================================
Article 166 : Exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and retail exposures
==========================================================
1. Unless noted otherwise, the exposure value of on-balance sheet exposures shall be the accounting value measured without taking into account any credit risk adjustments made.
==========================================================
This rule also applies to assets purchased at a price different than the amount owed.
==========================================================
For purchased assets, the difference between the amount owed and the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments have been applied that has been recorded on the balance-sheet of the institutions when purchasing the asset is denoted discount if the amount owed is larger, and premium if it is smaller.
==========================================================
2. Where institutions use Master netting agreements in relation to repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 4 or 6.
==========================================================
3. In order to calculate the exposure value for on-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits, institutions shall apply the methods set out in Chapter 4.
==========================================================
4. The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments shall comprise the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option (i.e. option the exercise of which is reasonably certain). If a party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased asset and this payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Article 213, the payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4.
==========================================================
5. In the case of any contract listed in Annex II, the exposure value shall be determined by the methods set out in Chapter 6 and shall not take into account any credit risk adjustment made.
==========================================================
6. The exposure value for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts of purchased receivables shall be the value determined in accordance with paragraph 1 minus the own funds requirements for dilution risk prior to credit risk mitigation.
==========================================================
7. Where an exposure takes the form of securities or commodities sold, posted or lent under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions, the exposure value shall be the value of the securities or commodities determined in accordance with Article 24. Where the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method as set out under Article 223 is used, the exposure value shall be increased by the volatility adjustment appropriate to such securities or commodities, as set out therein. The exposure value of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions may be determined either in accordance with Chapter 6 or Article 220(2).

a rating system shall take into account obligor and transaction risk characteristics.
==========================================================
a rating system shall have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default. The obligor rating scale shall have a minimum of 7 grades for non-defaulted obligors and one for defaulted obligors.
==========================================================
an institution shall document the relationship between obligor grades in terms of the level of default risk each grade implies and the criteria used to distinguish that level of default risk.

institutions with portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk shall have enough obligor grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of obligors in a particular grade. Significant concentrations within a single grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the obligor grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band and that the default risk posed by all obligors in the grade falls within that band.
==========================================================
to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction characteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades.

==========================================================
2. Institutions using the methods set out in 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures are exempt from the requirement to have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default for these exposures. These institutions shall have for these exposures at least 4 grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one grade for defaulted obligors.
==========================================================
3. The structure of rating systems for retail exposures shall comply with the following requirements .

The distribution of exposures and obligors across grades or pools shall be such as to avoid excessive concentrations.
==========================================================
the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools shall provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and shall allow for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at grade or pool level. For purchased receivables the grouping shall reflect the seller's underwriting practices and the heterogeneity of its customers.

==========================================================
obligor risk characteristics
==========================================================
transaction risk characteristics, including product or collateral types or both. Institutions shall explicitly address cases where several exposures benefit from the same collateral
==========================================================
delinquency, except where an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authority that delinquency is not a material driver of risk for the exposure
==========================================================
Article 171 : Assignment to grades or pools
==========================================================
1. An institution shall have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools within a rating system that comply with the following requirements .
==========================================================
the grade or pool definitions and criteria shall be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign obligors or facilities posing similar risk to the same grade or pool. This consistency shall exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations.
==========================================================

2. An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information.

Article 172 : Assignment of exposures
==========================================================
1. For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria 
==========================================================
each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process
==========================================================
for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process
==========================================================
institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures shall assign each of these exposures to a grade in accordance with Article 170(2)
==========================================================
each separate legal entity to which the institution is exposed shall be separately rated. An institution shall have appropriate policies regarding the treatment of individual obligor clients and groups of connected clients

separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same obligor grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. However, where separate exposures are allowed to result in multiple grades for the same obligor, the following shall apply ❬country transfer risk, this being dependent on whether the exposures are denominated in local or foreign currency and/or the treatment of associated guarantees to an exposure may be reflected in an adjusted assignment to an obligor grade and/or consumer protection, bank secrecy or other legislation prohibit the exchange of client data❭
==========================================================
2. For retail exposures, each exposure shall be assigned to a grade or a pool as part of the credit approval process.
==========================================================
3. For grade and pool assignments institutions shall document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. Institutions shall document these overrides and note down the personnel responsible. Institutions shall analyse the performance of the exposures whose assignments have been overridden.

Article 178 : Default of an obligor
==========================================================
1. A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following have taken place 
==========================================================
the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security
==========================================================
the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127
==========================================================
In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.
==========================================================
2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1 .
==========================================================
for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying amount is material.
==========================================================
for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution.
==========================================================
days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date.
==========================================================
materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers to be reasonable.

==========================================================
4. Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.
==========================================================
5. If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.

Article 180 : Requirements specific to PD estimation
==========================================================
1. In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to PD estimation to exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3) .
==========================================================
institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year default rates. PD estimates for obligors that are highly leveraged or for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets shall reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities.
==========================================================
for purchased corporate receivables institutions may estimate the EL by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year realised default rates.
==========================================================
if an institution derives long run average estimates of PDs and LGDs for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of EL, and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in Article 181(1)(a).

::::: ARGM-TMP: if an institution derives long run average estimates of pds and lgds for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of el , and an appropriate estimate of pd or lgd
==========================================================
institutions shall use PD estimation techniques only with supporting analysis. Institutions shall recognise the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information.
==========================================================
to the extent that an institution uses data on internal default experience for the estimation of PDs, the estimates shall be reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system. Where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, the institution shall add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD.
==========================================================
to the extent that an institution associates or maps its internal grades to the scale used by an ECAI or similar organisations and then attributes the default rate observed for the external organisation's grades to the institution's grades, mappings shall be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data shall be avoided. The criteria of the external organisation underlying the data used for quantification shall be oriented to default risk only and not reflect transaction characteristics. The analysis undertaken by the institution shall include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in Article 178. The institution shall document the basis for the mapping.

to the extent that an institution uses statistical default prediction models it is allowed to estimate PDs as the simple average of default-probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade. The institution's use of default probability models for this purpose shall meet the standards specified in Article 174.
==========================================================
irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data is relevant, this longer period shall be used. This point also applies to the PD/LGD Approach to equity. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions which have not received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGDs or conversion factors may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years.

Article 181 : Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates
==========================================================
1. In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-LGD estimates .
==========================================================
institutions shall estimate LGDs by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised LGDs by facility grade or pool using all observed defaults within the data sources (default weighted average).
==========================================================
institutions shall use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn.
==========================================================
an institution shall consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the obligor with that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of dependence shall be addressed in a conservative manner.
==========================================================
currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the collateral shall be treated conservatively in the institution's assessment of LGD.
==========================================================
to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, these estimates shall not solely be based on the collateral's estimated market value. LGD estimates shall take into account the effect of the potential inability of institutions to expeditiously gain control of their collateral and liquidate it.
==========================================================
to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, institutions shall establish internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management that are generally consistent with those set out in Chapter 4, Section 3.
==========================================================
to the extent that an institution recognises collateral for determining the exposure value for counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 5 or 6, any amount expected to be recovered from the collateral shall not be taken into account in the LGD estimates.
==========================================================
for the specific case of exposures already in default, the institution shall use the sum of its best estimate of expected loss for each exposure given current economic circumstances and exposure status and its estimate of the increase of loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period, i.e. between date of default and final liquidation of the exposure.
==========================================================
to the extent that unpaid late fees have been capitalised in the institution's income statement, they shall be added to the institution's measure of exposure and loss.
==========================================================
for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, estimates of LGD shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data is relevant, this longer period shall be used.

Article 182 : Requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates
==========================================================
1. In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates .
==========================================================
institutions shall estimate conversion factors by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool using the default weighted average resulting from all observed defaults within the data sources.
==========================================================
institutions shall use conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised conversion factors at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn.
==========================================================
institutions' estimates of conversion factors shall reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default event is triggered. The conversion factor estimate shall incorporate a larger margin of conservatism where a stronger positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of conversion factor.
==========================================================
in arriving at estimates of conversion factors institutions shall consider their specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. Institutions shall also consider their ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events.
==========================================================
institutions shall have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per obligor and per grade. The institution shall be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis.

Article 183 : Requirements for assessing the effect of guarantees and credit derivatives for exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks where own estimates of LGD are used and retail exposures
==========================================================
1. The following requirements shall apply in relation to eligible guarantors and guarantees 
==========================================================
institutions shall have clearly specified criteria for the types of guarantors they recognise for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
for recognised guarantors the same rules as for obligors as set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173 shall apply
==========================================================
the guarantee shall be evidenced in writing, non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor, in force until the obligation is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee) and legally enforceable against the guarantor in a jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a judgement. Conditional guarantees prescribing conditions under which the guarantor may not be obliged to perform may be recognised subject to permission of the competent authorities. The assignment criteria shall adequately address any potential reduction in the risk mitigation effect
==========================================================
2. An institution shall have clearly specified criteria for adjusting grades, pools or LGD estimates, and, in the case of retail and eligible purchased receivables, the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools, to reflect the impact of guarantees for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts. These criteria shall comply with the requirements set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173.
==========================================================
The criteria shall be plausible and intuitive. They shall address the guarantor's ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee, the likely timing of any payments from the guarantor, the degree to which the guarantor's ability to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the obligor's ability to repay, and the extent to which residual risk to the obligor remains.
==========================================================
3. The requirements for guarantees in this Article shall apply also for single-name credit derivatives. In relation to a mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation of the credit derivative or the obligation used for determining whether a credit event has occurred, the requirements set out under Article 216(2) shall apply. For retail exposures and eligible purchased receivables, this paragraph applies to the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools.
==========================================================
The criteria shall address the payout structure of the credit derivative and conservatively assess the impact this has on the level and timing of recoveries. The institution shall consider the extent to which other forms of residual risk remain.

Sub-Section 4 : Requirements for equity exposures under the internal models approach
==========================================================
Article 186 : Own funds requirement and risk quantification
==========================================================
For the purpose of calculating own funds requirements institutions shall meet the following standards 
==========================================================
the estimate of potential loss shall be robust to adverse market movements relevant to the long-term risk profile of the institution's specific holdings. The data used to represent return distributions shall reflect the longest sample period for which data is available and meaningful in representing the risk profile of the institution's specific equity exposures. The data used shall be sufficient to provide conservative, statistically reliable and robust loss estimates that are not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations. The shock employed shall provide a conservative estimate of potential losses over a relevant long-term market or business cycle. The institution shall combine empirical analysis of available data with adjustments based on a variety of factors in order to attain model outputs that achieve appropriate realism and conservatism. In constructing Value at Risk (VaR) models estimating potential quarterly losses, institutions may use quarterly data or convert shorter horizon period data to a quarterly equivalent using an analytically appropriate method supported by empirical evidence and through a well-developed and documented thought process and analysis. Such an approach shall be applied conservatively and consistently over time. Where only limited relevant data is available the institution shall add appropriate margins of conservatism

The internal models shall adequately explain historical price variation, capture both the magnitude and changes in the composition of potential concentrations, and be robust to adverse market environments. The population of risk exposures represented in the data used for estimation shall be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the institution's equity exposures
==========================================================
the internal model shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of an institution's equity portfolio. Where an institution has material holdings with values that are highly non-linear in nature the internal models shall be designed to capture appropriately the risks associated with such instruments

==========================================================
2. Where the risk-weighted exposure amount already takes account of credit protection under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, institutions shall not take into account that credit protection in the calculations under this Chapter.
==========================================================
3. Where the provisions in Sections 2 and 3 are met, institutions may amend the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach and the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4, 5 and 6.

==========================================================
4. Institutions may recognise funded credit protection in the calculation of the effect of credit risk mitigation only where the lending institution has the right to liquidate or retain, in a timely manner, the assets from which the protection derives in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy — or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation — of the obligor and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral. The degree of correlation between the value of the assets relied upon for protection and the credit quality of the obligor shall not be too high.

Article 216 : Additional requirements for credit derivatives
==========================================================
1. Credit derivative shall qualify as eligible unfunded credit protection where all the conditions in Article 213 and all the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
the credit events specified in the credit derivative contract include ❬the failure to pay the amounts due under the terms of the underlying obligation that are in effect at the time of such failure, with a grace period that is equal to or shorter than the grace period in the underlying obligation and/or the bankruptcy, insolvency or inability of the obligor to pay its debts, or its failure or admission in writing of its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due, and analogous events and/or the restructuring of the underlying obligation involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or fees that results in a credit loss event❭
==========================================================
where credit derivatives allow for cash settlement ❬institutions have in place a robust valuation process in order to estimate loss reliably and/or there is a clearly specified period for obtaining post-credit-event valuations of the underlying obligation❭
==========================================================
where the protection purchaser's right and ability to transfer the underlying obligation to the protection provider is required for settlement, the terms of the underlying obligation provide that any required consent to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld
==========================================================
the identity of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has occurred is clearly defined
==========================================================
the determination of the credit event is not the sole responsibility of the protection provider
==========================================================
the protection buyer has the right or ability to inform the protection provider of the occurrence of a credit event
==========================================================
SUBJ: the protection buyer
VERB: inform
DEST: the protection provider
DEST: of the occurrence of a credit event
FREQ: very likely reoccurring
==========================================================
Where the credit events do not include restructuring of the underlying obligation as described in point (a)(iii), the credit protection may nonetheless be eligible subject to a reduction in the value as specified in Article 233(2);
==========================================================
2. A mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation under the credit derivative or between the underlying obligation and the obligation used for purposes of determining whether a credit event has occurred is permissible only where both the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
Article 217 : Requirements to qualify for the treatment set out in Article 153(3)
==========================================================
1. To be eligible for the treatment set out in Article 153(3), credit protection deriving from a guarantee or credit derivative shall meet the following conditions 
==========================================================
the underlying obligation is to one of the following exposures ❬a corporate exposure as referred to in Article 147, excluding insurance and reinsurance undertakings and/or an exposure to a regional government, local authority or public sector entity which is not treated as an exposure to a central government or a central bank in accordance with Article 147 and/or an exposure to an SME, classified as a retail exposure in accordance with Article 147(5)❭
==========================================================
the underlying obligors are not members of the same group as the protection provider
==========================================================
the exposure is hedged by one of the following instruments ❬single-name unfunded credit derivatives or single-name guarantees and/or first-to-default basket products and/or nth-to-default basket products❭
==========================================================
the credit protection meets the requirements set out in Articles 213, 215 and 216, as applicable
==========================================================
the risk weight that is associated with the exposure prior to the application of the treatment set out in Article 153(3), does not already factor in any aspect of the credit protection
==========================================================
an institution has the right and expectation to receive payment from the protection provider without having to take legal action in order to pursue the counterparty for payment. To the extent possible, the institution shall take steps to satisfy itself that the protection provider is willing to pay promptly should a credit event occur
==========================================================
the purchased credit protection absorbs all credit losses incurred on the hedged portion of an exposure that arise due to the occurrence of credit events outlined in the contract
==========================================================
where the payout structure of the credit protection provides for physical settlement, there is legal certainty with respect to the deliverability of a loan, bond, or contingent liability
==========================================================
where an institution intends to deliver an obligation other than the underlying exposure, it shall ensure that the deliverable obligation is sufficiently liquid so that the institution would have the ability to purchase it for delivery in accordance with the contract
==========================================================
the terms and conditions of credit protection arrangements are legally confirmed in writing by both the protection provider and the institution
==========================================================
institutions have in place a process to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of a protection provider and the obligor of the underlying exposure due to their performance being dependent on common factors beyond the systematic risk factor
==========================================================
in the case of protection against dilution risk, the seller of purchased receivables is not a member of the same group as the protection provider
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of point (c)(ii) of paragraph 1, institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Article 153(3) to the asset within the basket with the lowest risk-weighted exposure amount.
==========================================================
3. For the purpose of point (c)(iii) of paragraph 1, the protection obtained is only eligible for consideration under this framework where eligible (n-1)th default protection has also been obtained or where (n-1) of the assets within the basket has or have already defaulted. Where this is the case, institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Article 153(3) to the asset within the basket with the lowest risk-weighted exposure amount.
==========================================================
Section 4 : Calculating the effects of credit risk mitigation
==========================================================
Sub-Section 1 : Funded credit protection
==========================================================
Article 218 : Credit linked notes
==========================================================
Investments in credit linked notes issued by the lending institution may be treated as cash collateral for the purpose of calculating the effect of funded credit protection in accordance with this Sub-section, provided that the credit default swap embedded in the credit linked note qualifies as eligible unfunded credit protection. For the purpose of determining whether the credit default swap embedded in a credit linked note qualifies as eligible unfunded credit protection, the institution may consider the condition in point (c) of Article 194(6) to be met.
==========================================================
Article 219 : On-balance sheet netting
==========================================================
Loans to and deposits with the lending institution subject to on-balance sheet netting are to be treated by that institution as cash collateral for the purpose of calculating the effect of funded credit protection for those loans and deposits of the lending institution subject to on-balance sheet netting which are denominated in the same currency.
==========================================================
Article 220 : Using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Volatility Adjustments Approach for master netting agreements
==========================================================
1. When institutions calculate the "fully adjusted exposure value" (E*) for the exposures subject to an eligible master netting agreement covering repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions, they shall calculate the volatility adjustments that they need to apply either by using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Volatility Adjustments Approach ("Own Estimates Approach") as set out in Articles 223 to 226 for the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method.
==========================================================
The use of the Own Estimates Approach shall be subject to the same conditions and requirements as apply under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall calculate the net position in each group of securities or in each type of commodity by subtracting the amount in point (ii) from the amount in point (i) the total value of a group of securities or of commodities of the same type lent, sold or provided under the master netting agreement.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall calculate the net position in each group of securities or in each type of commodity by subtracting the amount in point (ii) from the amount in point (i) the total value of a group of securities or of commodities of the same type borrowed, purchased or received under the master netting agreement.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall calculate the net position in each currency, other than the settlement currency of the master netting agreement, by subtracting the amount in point (ii) from the amount in point (i) the sum of the total value of securities denominated in that currency lent, sold or provided under the master netting agreement and the amount of cash in that currency lent or transferred under that agreement.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall calculate the net position in each currency, other than the settlement currency of the master netting agreement, by subtracting the amount in point (ii) from the amount in point (i) the sum of the total value of securities denominated in that currency borrowed, purchased or received under the master netting agreement and the amount of cash in that currency borrowed or received under that agreement.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall apply the volatility adjustment appropriate to a given group of securities or to a cash position to the absolute value of the positive or negative net position in the securities in that group.
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of calculating E*, institutions shall apply the foreign exchange risk (fx) volatility adjustment to the net positive or negative position in each currency other than the settlement currency of the master netting agreement.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall calculate E* according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
Ei = the exposure value for each separate exposure i under the agreement that would apply in the absence of the credit protection, where institutions calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach or where they calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach;
==========================================================
Ci = the value of securities in each group or commodities of the same type borrowed, purchased or received or the cash borrowed or received in respect of each exposure i; = the net position (positive or negative) in a given group of securities j; = the net position (positive or negative) in a given currency k other than the settlement currency of the agreement as calculated under point (b) of paragraph 2; = the volatility adjustment appropriate to a particular group of securities j; = the foreign exchange volatility adjustment for currency k.
==========================================================
4. For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions covered by master netting agreements, institutions shall use E* as calculated under paragraph 3 as the exposure value of the exposure to the counterparty arising from the transactions subject to the master netting agreement for the purposes of Article 113 under the Standardised Approach or Chapter 3 under the IRB Approach.
==========================================================
5. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, "group of securities" means securities which are issued by the same entity, have the same issue date, the same maturity, are subject to the same terms and conditions, and are subject to the same liquidation periods as indicated in Articles 224 and 225, as applicable.
==========================================================
Article 221 : Using the Internal Models Approach for Master netting agreements
==========================================================
1. Subject to permission of competent authorities, institutions may, as an alternative to using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Approach in calculating the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) resulting from the application of an eligible master netting agreement covering repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, or other capital market driven transactions other than derivative transactions, use an internal models approach which takes into account correlation effects between security positions subject to the master netting agreement as well as the liquidity of the instruments concerned.
==========================================================
2. Subject to the permission of the competent authorities, institutions may also use their internal models for margin lending transactions, where the transactions are covered under a bilateral master netting agreement that meets the requirements set out in Chapter 6, Section 7.
==========================================================
3. An institution may choose to use an internal models approach independently of the choice it has made between the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. However, where an institution seeks to use an internal models approach, it shall do so for all counterparties and securities, excluding immaterial portfolios where it may use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Approach as laid down in Article 220.
==========================================================
Institutions that have received permission for an internal risk-management model under Title IV, Chapter 5 may use the internal models approach. Where an institution has not received such permission, it may still apply for permission to the competent authorities to use an internal models approach for the purposes of this Article.
==========================================================
4. Competent authorities shall permit an institution to use an internal models approach only where they are satisfied that the institution's system for managing the risks arising from the transactions covered by the master netting agreement is conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and where the following qualitative standards are met 
==========================================================

==========================================================
the institution has established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of the risk-measurement system
==========================================================
the institution's models have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks demonstrated through the back-testing of its output using at least one year of data
==========================================================
the institution frequently conducts a rigorous programme of stress testing and the results of these tests are reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets
==========================================================
the institution conducts, as part of its regular internal auditing process, an independent review of its risk-measurement system. This review shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk-control unit
==========================================================
SUBJ: this review
VERB: include
DATA: both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk - control unit
FREQ: likely reoccurring

==========================================================
the internal model meets the requirements set out in Article 292(8) and (9) and in Article 294
==========================================================
5. An institution's internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors in order to capture all material price risks.
==========================================================
An institution may use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories where its system for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.
==========================================================
6. Institutions using the internal models approach shall calculate E* according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
Ei = the exposure value for each separate exposure i under the agreement that would apply in the absence of the credit protection, where institutions calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach or where they calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach;
==========================================================
Ci = the value of the securities borrowed, purchased or received or the cash borrowed or received in respect of each such exposure i.
==========================================================
When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts using internal models, institutions shall use the previous business day's model output.
==========================================================
7. The calculation of the potential change in value referred to in paragraph 6 shall be subject to all the following standards 
==========================================================
it shall be carried out at least daily
==========================================================
it shall be based on a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval
==========================================================
it shall be based on a 5-day equivalent liquidation period, except in the case of transactions other than securities repurchase transactions or securities lending or borrowing transactions where a 10-day equivalent liquidation period shall be used
==========================================================
it shall be based on an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility
==========================================================
the data set used in the calculation shall be updated every three months
==========================================================
Where an institution has a repurchase transaction, a securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction and margin lending or similar transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with Article 285(5).
==========================================================
8. For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions covered by master netting agreements, institutions shall use E* as calculated under paragraph 6 as the exposure value of the exposure to the counterparty arising from the transactions subject to the master netting agreement for the purposes of Article 113 under the Standardised Approach or Chapter 3 under the IRB Approach.
==========================================================
9. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following 
==========================================================
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2015.

==========================================================
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
==========================================================
Article 222 : Financial Collateral Simple Method
==========================================================
1. Institutions may use the Financial Collateral Simple Method only where they calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach. Institution shall not use both the Financial Collateral Simple Method and the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, except for the purposes of Articles 148(1) and 150(1). Institutions shall not use this exception selectively with the purpose of achieving reduced own funds requirements or with the purpose of conducting regulatory arbitrage.
==========================================================
2. Under the Financial Collateral Simple Method institutions shall assign to eligible financial collateral a value equal to its market value as determined in accordance with point (d) of Article 207(4).
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall assign to those portions of exposure values that are collateralised by the market value of eligible collateral the risk weight that they would assign under Chapter 2 where the lending institution had a direct exposure to the collateral instrument. For this purpose, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet item listed in Annex I shall be equal to 100 % of the item's value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(1).
==========================================================
The risk weight of the collateralised portion shall be at least 20 % except as specified in paragraphs 4 to 6. Institutions shall apply to the remainder of the exposure value the risk weight that they would assign to an unsecured exposure to the counterparty under Chapter 2.
==========================================================
4. Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 % to the collateralised portion of the exposure arising from repurchase transaction and securities lending or borrowing transactions which fulfil the criteria in Article 227. Where the counterparty to the transaction is not a core market participant, institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %.
==========================================================
5. Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values determined under Chapter 6 for the derivative instruments listed in Annex II and subject to daily marking-to-market, collateralised by cash or cash-assimilated instruments where there is no currency mismatch.
==========================================================
Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values of such transactions collateralised by debt securities issued by central governments or central banks which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Chapter 2.
==========================================================
6. For transactions other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, institutions may assign a 0 % risk weight where the exposure and the collateral are denominated in the same currency, and either of the following conditions is met 
==========================================================
7. For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include debt securities issued by regional governments or local authorities exposures to which are treated as exposures to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established under Article 115.
==========================================================
7. For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include debt securities issued by multilateral development banks to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under or by virtue of Article 117(2).
==========================================================
7. For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include debt securities issued by international organisations which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 118.
==========================================================
7. For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include debt securities issued by public sector entities which are treated as exposures to central governments in accordance with Article 116(4).
==========================================================
Article 223 : Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method
==========================================================
1. In order to take account of price volatility, institutions shall apply volatility adjustments to the market value of collateral, as set out in Articles 224 to 227, when valuing financial collateral for the purposes of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method.
==========================================================
Where collateral is denominated in a currency that differs from the currency in which the underlying exposure is denominated, institutions shall add an adjustment reflecting currency volatility to the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral as set out in Articles 224 to 227.
==========================================================
In the case of OTC derivatives transactions covered by netting agreements recognised by the competent authorities under Chapter 6, institutions shall apply a volatility adjustment reflecting currency volatility when there is a mismatch between the collateral currency and the settlement currency. Even where multiple currencies are involved in the transactions covered by the netting agreement, institutions shall apply a single volatility adjustment.
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (CVA) they need to take into account as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
C = the value of the collateral;
==========================================================
HC = the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227;
==========================================================
Hfx = the volatility adjustment appropriate to currency mismatch, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227.
==========================================================
Institutions shall use the formula in this paragraph when calculating the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral for all transactions except for those transactions subject to recognised master netting agreements to which the provisions set out in Articles 220 and 221 apply.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the exposure (EVA) they need to take into account as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
E = the exposure value as would be determined under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, where the exposure was not collateralised;
==========================================================
HE = the volatility adjustment appropriate to the exposure, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227.
==========================================================
In the case of OTC derivative transactions institutions shall calculate EVA as follows:
==========================================================
.
==========================================================
4. For the purpose of calculating E in paragraph 3, for institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet item listed in Annex I shall be 100 % of that item's value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(1).
==========================================================
4. For the purpose of calculating E in paragraph 3, for institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the IRB Approach, they shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs.
==========================================================
5. Institutions shall calculate the fully adjusted value of the exposure (E*), taking into account both volatility and the risk-mitigating effects of collateral as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
EVA = the volatility adjusted value of the exposure as calculated in paragraph 3;
==========================================================
CVAM = CVA further adjusted for any maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Section 5;
==========================================================
6. Institutions may calculate volatility adjustments either by using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach referred to in Article 224 or the Own Estimates Approach referred to in Article 225.
==========================================================
An institution may choose to use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach or the Own Estimates Approach independently of the choice it has made between the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts.
==========================================================
However, where an institution uses the Own Estimates Approach, it shall do so for the full range of instrument types, excluding immaterial portfolios where it may use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach.
==========================================================
7. Where the collateral consists of a number of eligible items, institutions shall calculate the volatility adjustment (H) as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
ai = the proportion of the value of an eligible item i in the total value of collateral;
==========================================================
Hi = the volatility adjustment applicable to eligible item i.
==========================================================

3. In Tables 1 to 4 of paragraph 1 and in paragraphs 4 to 6, the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated is the credit quality step with which the credit assessment is determined by EBA to be associated under Chapter 2.
==========================================================
For the purpose of determining the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated referred to in the first subparagraph, Article 197(7) also applies.
==========================================================
4. For non-eligible securities or for commodities lent or sold under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the volatility adjustment is the same as for non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange.
==========================================================
5. For eligible units in CIUs the volatility adjustment is the weighted average volatility adjustments that would apply, having regard to the liquidation period of the transaction as specified in paragraph 2, to the assets in which the fund has invested.
==========================================================
Where the assets in which the fund has invested are not known to the institution, the volatility adjustment is the highest volatility adjustment that would apply to any of the assets in which the fund has the right to invest.
==========================================================
6. For unrated debt securities issued by institutions and satisfying the eligibility criteria in Article 197(4) the volatility adjustments is the same as for securities issued by institutions or corporates with an external credit assessment associated with credit quality steps 2 or 3.
==========================================================
Article 225 : Own estimates of volatility adjustments under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method
==========================================================
1. The competent authorities shall permit institutions to use their own volatility estimates for calculating the volatility adjustments to be applied to collateral and exposures where those institutions comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. Institutions which have obtained permission to use their own volatility estimates shall not revert to the use of other methods except for demonstrated good cause and subject to the permission of the competent authorities.
==========================================================
For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to investment grade or better, institutions may calculate a volatility estimate for each category of security.
==========================================================
For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to below investment grade, and for other eligible collateral, institutions shall calculate the volatility adjustments for each individual item.
==========================================================
Institutions using the Own Estimates Approach shall estimate volatility of the collateral or foreign exchange mismatch without taking into account any correlations between the unsecured exposure, collateral or exchange rates.
==========================================================
In determining relevant categories, institutions shall take into account the type of issuer of the security, the external credit assessment of the securities, their residual maturity, and their modified duration. Volatility estimates shall be representative of the securities included in the category by the institution.
==========================================================
2. The calculation of the volatility adjustments shall be subject to all the following criteria 
==========================================================
institutions shall base the calculation on a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval
==========================================================
institutions shall base the calculation on the following liquidation periods ❬20 business days for secured lending transactions and/or 5 business days for repurchase transaction, except insofar as such transactions involve the transfer of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities and securities lending or borrowing transactions and/or 10 business days for other capital market driven transactions❭
==========================================================
institutions may use volatility adjustment numbers calculated according to shorter or longer liquidation periods, scaled up or down to the liquidation period set out in point (b) for the type of transaction in question, using the square root of time formula ❬where ⟨⟩ and/or TM = the relevant liquidation period and/or HM = the volatility adjustment based on the liquidation period TM and/or HN = the volatility adjustment based on the liquidation period TN❭
==========================================================
institutions shall take into account the illiquidity of lower-quality assets. They shall adjust the liquidation period upwards in cases where there is doubt concerning the liquidity of the collateral. They shall also identify where historical data may understate potential volatility. Such cases shall be dealt with by means of a stress scenario
==========================================================
the length of the historical observation period institutions use for calculating volatility adjustments shall be at least one year. For institutions that use a weighting scheme or other methods for the historical observation period, the length of the effective observation period shall be at least one year. The competent authorities may also require an institution to calculate its volatility adjustments using a shorter observation period where, in the competent authorities' judgement, this is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility
==========================================================
institutions shall update their data sets and calculate volatility adjustments at least once every three months. They shall also reassess their data sets whenever market prices are subject to material changes
==========================================================
3. The estimation of volatility adjustments shall meet all the following qualitative criteria 
==========================================================
an institutions shall use the volatility estimates in the day-to-day risk management process including in relation to its internal exposure limits
==========================================================
where the liquidation period used by an institution in its day-to-day risk management process is longer than that set out in this Section for the type of transaction in question, that institution shall scale up its volatility adjustments in accordance with the square root of time formula set out in point (c) of paragraph 2

Article 226 : Scaling up of volatility adjustment under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive method
==========================================================
The volatility adjustments set out in Article 224 are the volatility adjustments an institution shall apply where there is daily revaluation. Similarly, where an institution uses its own estimates of the volatility adjustments in accordance with Article 225, it shall calculate them in the first instance on the basis of daily revaluation. Where the frequency of revaluation is less than daily, institutions shall apply larger volatility adjustments. Institutions shall calculate them by scaling up the daily revaluation volatility adjustments, using the following square-root-of-time formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
H = the volatility adjustment to be applied;
==========================================================
HM = the volatility adjustment where there is daily revaluation;
==========================================================
NR = the actual number of business days between revaluations;
==========================================================
TM = the liquidation period for the type of transaction in question.
==========================================================
Article 227 : Conditions for applying a 0 % volatility adjustment under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive method
==========================================================
1. In relation to repurchase transactions and securities lending or borrowing transactions, where an institution uses the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach under Article 224 or the Own Estimates Approach under Article 225 and where the conditions set out in points (a) to (h) of paragraph 2 are satisfied, institutions may, instead of applying the volatility adjustments calculated under Articles 224 to 226, apply a 0 % volatility adjustment. Institutions using the internal models approach set out in Article 221 shall not use the treatment set out in this Article.
==========================================================
2. Institutions may apply a 0 % volatility adjustment where all the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
3. The core market participants referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 shall include the following entities 
==========================================================
Article 228 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive method
==========================================================
1. Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall use E* as calculated under Article 223(5) as the exposure value for the purposes of Article 113. In the case of off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I, institutions shall use E* as the value to which the percentages indicated in Article 111(1) shall be applied to arrive at the exposure value.
==========================================================
2. Under the IRB Approach, institutions shall use the effective LGD (LGD*) as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3. Institutions shall calculate LGD* as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
LGD = the LGD that would apply to the exposure under Chapter 3 where the exposure was not collateralised;
==========================================================
E = the exposure value in accordance with Article 223(3);
==========================================================
E* = the fully adjusted exposure value in accordance with Article 223(5).
==========================================================
Article 229 : Valuation principles for other eligible collateral under the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. For immovable property collateral, the collateral shall be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the market value. An institution shall require the independent valuer to document the market value in a transparent and clear manner.
==========================================================
SUBJ: the independent valuer
VERB: document
DATA: the market value
FREQ: likely reoccurring
FREQ: maybe happening once
::::: ARGM-MNR: in a transparent and clear manner
==========================================================
In those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions the property may instead be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the mortgage lending value. Institutions shall require the independent valuer not to take into account speculative elements in the assessment of the mortgage lending value and to document that value in a transparent and clear manner.
==========================================================
The value of the collateral shall be the market value or mortgage lending value reduced as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3) and to take account of any prior claims on the property.
==========================================================
2. For receivables, the value of receivables shall be the amount receivable.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall value physical collateral other than immovable property at its market value. For the purposes of this Article, the market value is the estimated amount for which the property would exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction.
==========================================================
Article 230 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for other eligible collateral under the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall use LGD* calculated in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph 2 as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3.
==========================================================
Where the ratio of the value of the collateral (C) to the exposure value (E) is below the required minimum collateralisation level of the exposure (C*) as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be the LGD laid down in Chapter 3 for uncollateralised exposures to the counterparty. For this purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor or percentage of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs.
==========================================================
Where the ratio of the value of the collateral to the exposure value exceeds a second, higher threshold level of C** as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be that prescribed in Table 5.
==========================================================
Where the required level of collateralisation C** is not achieved in respect of the exposure as a whole, institutions shall consider the exposure to be two exposures — one corresponding to the part in respect of which the required level of collateralisation C** is achieved and one corresponding to the remainder.
==========================================================
2. The applicable LGD* and required collateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures are set out in Table 5 of this paragraph.
==========================================================
Table 5

==========================================================
3. As an alternative to the treatment set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, and subject to Article 124(2), institutions may assign a 50 % risk weight to the part of the exposure that is, within the limits set out in Article 125(2)(d) and Article 126(2)(d) respectively, fully collateralised by residential property or commercial immovable property situated within the territory of a Member State where all the conditions in Article 199(4) are met.
==========================================================
Article 231 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in the case of mixed pools of collateral
==========================================================
1. An institution shall calculate the value of LGD* that it shall use as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3 in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 where both the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall be required to subdivide the volatility-adjusted value of the exposure, obtained by applying the volatility adjustment as set out in Article 223(5) to the value of the exposure, into parts so as to obtain a part covered by eligible financial collateral, a part covered by receivables, a part covered by commercial immovable property collateral or residential property collateral, a part covered by other eligible collateral, and the unsecured part, as applicable.
==========================================================
3. Institutions shall calculate LGD* for each part of the exposure obtained in paragraph 2 separately in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Chapter.
==========================================================
Article 232 : Other funded credit protection
==========================================================
1. Where the conditions set out in Article 212(1) are met, deposits with third party institutions may be treated as a guarantee by the third party institution.
==========================================================
2. Where the conditions set out in Article 212(2) are met, institutions shall subject the portion of the exposure collateralised by the current surrender value of life insurance policies pledged to the lending institution to the following treatment 
==========================================================
where the exposure is subject to the Standardised Approach, it shall be risk-weighted by using the risk weights specified in paragraph 3
==========================================================
where the exposure is subject to the IRB Approach but not subject to the institution's own estimates of LGD, it shall be assigned an LGD of 40 %
==========================================================
In the event of a currency mismatch, institutions shall reduce the current surrender value in accordance with Article 233(3), the value of the credit protection being the current surrender value of the life insurance policy.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 2, institutions shall assign the following risk weights on the basis of the risk weight assigned to a senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance 
==========================================================

==========================================================
where the instrument will be repurchased at its face value, the value of the protection shall be that amount
==========================================================
where the instrument will be repurchased at market price, the value of the protection shall be the value of the instrument valued in the same way as the debt securities that meet the conditions in Article 197(4)
==========================================================
Sub-Section 2 : Unfunded credit protection
==========================================================
Article 233 : Valuation
==========================================================
1. For the purpose of calculating the effects of unfunded credit protection in accordance with this Sub-section, the value of unfunded credit protection (G) shall be the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay in the event of the default or non-payment of the borrower or on the occurrence of other specified credit events.
==========================================================
2. In the case of credit derivatives which do not include as a credit event restructuring of the underlying obligation involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or fees that result in a credit loss event, where the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay is not higher than the exposure value, institutions shall reduce the value of the credit protection calculated under paragraph 1 by 40 %.
==========================================================
2. In the case of credit derivatives which do not include as a credit event restructuring of the underlying obligation involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or fees that result in a credit loss event, where the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay is higher than the exposure value, the value of the credit protection shall be no higher than 60 % of the exposure value.
==========================================================
3. Where unfunded credit protection is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated, institutions shall reduce the value of the credit protection by the application of a volatility adjustment as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
G* = the amount of credit protection adjusted for foreign exchange risk,
==========================================================
G = the nominal amount of the credit protection;
==========================================================
Hfx = the volatility adjustment for any currency mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying obligation determined in accordance with paragraph 4.
==========================================================
Where there is no currency mismatch Hfx is equal to zero.
==========================================================
4. Institutions shall base the volatility adjustments for any currency mismatch on a 10 business day liquidation period, assuming daily revaluation, and may calculate them based on the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments approach or the Own Estimates Approach as set out in Articles 224 and 225 respectively. Institutions shall scale up the volatility adjustments in accordance with Article 226.
==========================================================
Article 234 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in the event of partial protection and tranching
==========================================================
Where an institution transfers a part of the risk of a loan in one or more tranches, the rules set out in Chapter 5 shall apply. Institutions may consider materiality thresholds on payments below which no payment shall be made in the event of loss to be equivalent to retained first loss positions and to give rise to a tranched transfer of risk.
==========================================================
Article 235 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach
==========================================================
1. For the purposes of Article 113(3) institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
E = the exposure value in accordance with Article 111; for this purpose, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet item listed in Annex I shall be 100 % of its value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(1);
==========================================================
GA = the amount of credit risk protection as calculated under Article 233(3) (G*) further adjusted for any maturity mismatch as laid down in Section 5;
==========================================================
r = the risk weight of exposures to the obligor as specified under Chapter 2;
==========================================================
g = the risk weight of exposures to the protection provider as specified under Chapter 2.
==========================================================
2. Where the protected amount (GA) is less than the exposure (E), institutions may apply the formula specified in paragraph 1 only where the protected and unprotected parts of the exposure are of equal seniority.
==========================================================
3. Institutions may extend the treatment set out in Article 114(4) and (7) to exposures or parts of exposures guaranteed by the central government or central bank, where the guarantee is denominated in the domestic currency of the borrower and the exposure is funded in that currency.
==========================================================
Article 236 : Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. For the covered portion of the exposure value (E), based on the adjusted value of the credit protection GA, the PD for the purposes of Section 4 of Chapter 3 may be the PD of the protection provider, or a PD between that of the borrower and that of the guarantor where a full substitution is deemed not to be warranted. In the case of subordinated exposures and non-subordinated unfunded protection, the LGD to be applied by institutions for the purposes of Section 4 of Chapter 3 may be that associated with senior claims.
==========================================================
2. For any uncovered portion of the exposure value (E) the PD shall be that of the borrower and the LGD shall be that of the underlying exposure.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of this Article, GA is the value of G* as calculated under Article 233(3) further adjusted for any maturity mismatch as laid down in Section 5. E is the exposure value determined in accordance with Section 5 of Chapter 3. For this purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor or percentage of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs.
==========================================================
Section 5 : Maturity mismatches
==========================================================
Article 237 : Maturity mismatch
==========================================================
1. For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of the credit protection is less than that of the protected exposure. Where protection has a residual maturity of less than three months and the maturity of the protection is less than the maturity of the underlying exposure that protection does not qualify as eligible credit protection.
==========================================================
2. Where there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection shall not qualify as eligible where either of the following conditions is met 
==========================================================
Article 238 : Maturity of credit protection
==========================================================
1. Subject to a maximum of five years, the effective maturity of the underlying shall be the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligations. Subject to paragraph 2, the maturity of the credit protection shall be the time to the earliest date at which the protection may terminate or be terminated.
==========================================================
2. Where there is an option to terminate the protection which is at the discretion of the protection seller, institutions shall take the maturity of the protection to be the time to the earliest date at which that option may be exercised. Where there is an option to terminate the protection which is at the discretion of the protection buyer and the terms of the arrangement at origination of the protection contain a positive incentive for the institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, an institution shall take the maturity of the protection to be the time to the earliest date at which that option may be exercised; otherwise the institution may consider that such an option does not affect the maturity of the protection.
==========================================================
3. Where a credit derivative is not prevented from terminating prior to expiration of any grace period required for a default on the underlying obligation to occur as a result of a failure to pay institutions shall reduce the maturity of the protection by the length of the grace period.
==========================================================
Article 239 : Valuation of protection
==========================================================
1. For transactions subject to funded credit protection under the Financial Collateral Simple Method, where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection, the collateral does not qualify as eligible funded credit protection.
==========================================================
2. For transactions subject to funded credit protection under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, institutions shall reflect the maturity of the credit protection and of the exposure in the adjusted value of the collateral according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
CVA = the volatility adjusted value of the collateral as specified in Article 223(2) or the amount of the exposure, whichever is lower;
==========================================================
t = the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the credit protection calculated in accordance with Article 238, or the value of T, whichever is lower;
==========================================================
T = the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the exposure calculated in accordance with Article 238, or five years, whichever is lower;
==========================================================
t* = 0,25.
==========================================================
Institutions shall use CVAM as CVA further adjusted for maturity mismatch in the formula for the calculation of the fully adjusted value of the exposure (E*) set out in Article 223(5).
==========================================================
3. For transactions subject to unfunded credit protection, institutions shall reflect the maturity of the credit protection and of the exposure in the adjusted value of the credit protection according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
GA = G* adjusted for any maturity mismatch;
==========================================================
G* = the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch;
==========================================================
t = is the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the credit protection calculated in accordance with Article 238, or the value of T, whichever is lower;
==========================================================
T = is the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the exposure calculated in accordance with Article 238, or five years, whichever is lower;
==========================================================
t* = 0,25.
==========================================================
Institutions shall use GA as the value of the protection for the purposes of Articles 233 to 236.
==========================================================
Section 6 : Basket CRM techniques
==========================================================
Article 240 : First-to-default credit derivatives
==========================================================
Where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the first default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may amend the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount and, as relevant, the expected loss amount of the exposure which would, in the absence of the credit protection, produce the lowest risk weighted exposure amount in accordance with this Chapter for institutions using the Standardised Approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be that calculated under the Standardised Approach.
==========================================================
Where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the first default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may amend the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount and, as relevant, the expected loss amount of the exposure which would, in the absence of the credit protection, produce the lowest risk weighted exposure amount in accordance with this Chapter for institutions using the IRB Approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be the sum of the risk-weighted exposure amount calculated under the IRB Approach and 12.5 times the expected loss amount.
==========================================================
The treatment set out in this Article applies only where the exposure value is less than or equal to the value of the credit protection.
==========================================================
Article 241 : Nth-to-default credit derivatives
==========================================================
Where the nth default among the exposures triggers payment under the credit protection, the institution purchasing the protection may only recognise the protection for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and, as applicable, expected loss amounts where protection has also been obtained for defaults 1 to n-1 or when n-1 defaults have already occurred. In such cases, the institution may amend the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount and, as applicable, the expected loss amount of the exposure which would, in the absence of the credit protection, produce the n-th lowest risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with this Chapter. Institutions shall calculate the nth lowest amount as specified in points (a) and (b) of Article 240.
==========================================================
The treatment set out in this Article applies only where the exposure value is less than or equal to the value of the credit protection.
==========================================================
All exposures in the basket shall meet the requirements laid down in Article 204(2) and Article 216(1)(d).

Section 3 : Calculation of the risk weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
Sub-Section 1 : Principles
==========================================================
Article 245 : Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
1. Where an originator institution has transferred significant credit risk associated with securitised exposures in accordance with Section 2, that institution may in the case of a traditional securitisation, exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, the exposures which it has securitised.
==========================================================
1. Where an originator institution has transferred significant credit risk associated with securitised exposures in accordance with Section 2, that institution may in the case of a synthetic securitisation, calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, in respect of the securitised exposures in accordance with Articles 249 and 250.
==========================================================
2. Where the originator institution has decided to apply paragraph 1, it shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts prescribed in this Chapter for the positions that it may hold in the securitisation.
==========================================================
Where the originator institution has not transferred significant credit risk or has decided not to apply paragraph 1, it need not calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for any positions it may have in the securitisation in question but shall continue including the securitised exposures in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts as if they had not been securitised.
==========================================================
3. Where there is an exposure to different tranches in a securitisation, the exposure to each tranche shall be considered a separate securitisation position. The providers of credit protection to securitisation positions shall be considered to hold positions in the securitisation. Securitisation positions shall include exposures to a securitisation arising from interest rate or currency derivative contracts.
==========================================================
4. Unless a securitisation position is deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items pursuant to Article 36(1)(k), the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be included in the institution's total of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(3).
==========================================================
5. The risk-weighted exposure amount of a securitisation position shall be calculated by applying to the exposure value of the position, calculated as set out in Article 246, the relevant total risk weight.
==========================================================
6. The total risk weight shall be determined as the sum of the risk weight set out in this Chapter and any additional risk weight in accordance with Article 407.
==========================================================
Article 246 : Exposure value
==========================================================
1. The exposure value shall be calculated as described in the following list 
==========================================================
where an institution calculates risk-weighted exposure amounts under Sub-section 3, the exposure value of an on-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments treated in accordance with Article 110 have been applied
==========================================================
where an institution calculates risk-weighted exposure amounts under Sub-section 4, the exposure value of an on-balance sheet securitisation position shall be the accounting value measured without taking into account any credit risk adjustments treated in accordance with Article 110 made
==========================================================
where an institution calculates risk-weighted exposure amounts under Sub-section 3, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value, less any specific credit risk adjustment of that securitisation position, multiplied by a conversion factor as prescribed in this Chapter. The conversion factor shall be 100 % unless otherwise specified
==========================================================
where an institution calculates risk-weighted exposure amounts under Sub-section 4, the exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value multiplied by a conversion factor as prescribed in this Chapter. The conversion factor shall be 100 % unless otherwise specified
==========================================================
The exposure value for the counterparty credit risk of a derivative instrument listed in Annex II, shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 6
==========================================================
2. Where an institution has two or more overlapping positions in a securitisation, it shall, to the extent that they overlap include in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts only the position or portion of a position producing the higher risk-weighted exposure amounts. The institution may also recognise such overlap between specific risk own funds requirements for positions in the trading book and own funds requirements for securitisation positions in the non-trading book, provided that the institution is able to calculate and compare the own funds requirements for the relevant positions. For the purpose of this paragraph, overlapping occurs when the positions, wholly or partially, represent an exposure to the same risk such that, to the extent of the overlap, there is a single exposure.
==========================================================
3. Where Article 268(c) applies to positions in the ABCP, the institution may, use the risk-weight assigned to a liquidity facility in order to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for the ABCP provided that 100 % of the ABCP issued by the programme is covered by this or other liquidity facilities and all of those liquidity facilities rank pari passu with the ABCP so that they form overlapping positions.
==========================================================
The institution shall notify to the competent authorities the use it makes of that treatment.

Article 247 : Recognition of credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions
==========================================================
1. An institution may recognise funded or unfunded credit protection obtained in respect of a securitisation position in accordance with Chapter 4 and subject to the requirements laid down in this Chapter and in Chapter 4.
==========================================================
Eligible funded credit protection is limited to financial collateral which is eligible for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 as laid down under Chapter 4 and recognition is subject to compliance with the relevant requirements as laid down under Chapter 4.
==========================================================
2. Eligible unfunded credit protection and unfunded credit protection providers are limited to those which are eligible under Chapter 4 and recognition is subject to compliance with the relevant requirements laid down under Chapter 4.
==========================================================
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the eligible providers of unfunded credit protection listed in points (a) to (h) of Article 201(1) except for qualifying central counterparties shall have a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI which has been determined to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under Article 136 and shall have been associated with credit quality step 2 or above at the time the credit protection was first recognised. Institutions that have a permission to apply the IRB Approach to a direct exposure to the protection provider may assess eligibility according to the first sentence based on the equivalence of the PD for the protection provider to the PD associated with the credit quality steps referred to in Article 136.
==========================================================
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, SSPEs are eligible protection providers where they own assets that qualify as eligible financial collateral and to which there are no rights or contingent rights preceding or ranking pari passu to the contingent rights of the institution receiving unfunded credit protection and all requirements for the recognition of financial collateral in Chapter 4 are fulfilled. In those cases, GA (the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch and maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4) shall be limited to the volatility adjusted market value of those assets and g (the risk weight of exposures to the protection provider as specified under the Standardised Approach) shall be determined as the weighted-average risk weight that would apply to those assets as financial collateral under the Standardised Approach.
==========================================================
Article 248 : Implicit support
==========================================================
1. A sponsor institution, or an originator institution which in respect of a securitisation has made use of Article 245(1) and (2) in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts or has sold instruments from its trading book to the effect that it is no longer required to hold own funds for the risks of those instruments shall not, with a view to reducing potential or actual losses to investors, provide support to the securitisation beyond its contractual obligations. A transaction shall not be considered to provide support if it is executed at arm's length conditions and taken into account in the assessment of significant risk transfer. Any such transaction shall be, regardless of whether it provides support, notified to the competent authorities and subject to the institution's credit review and approval process. The institution shall, when assessing whether the transaction is not structured to provide support, adequately consider at least all the following

==========================================================
Sub-Section 2 : Originator institutions' calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts securitised in a synthetic securitisation
==========================================================
Article 249 : General treatment
==========================================================
In calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for the securitised exposures, where the conditions in Article 244 are met, the originator institution of a synthetic securitisation shall, subject to Article 250, use the relevant calculation methodologies set out in this Section and not those set out in Chapter 2. For institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under Chapter 3, the expected loss amount in respect of such exposures shall be zero.
==========================================================
The requirements set out in the first subparagraph apply to the entire pool of exposures included in the securitisation. Subject to Article 250, the originator institution shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in respect of all tranches in the securitisation in accordance with the provisions of this Section including those for which the institution recognises credit risk mitigation in accordance with Article 247, in which case the risk-weight to be applied to that position may be amended in accordance with Chapter 4, subject to the requirements laid down in this Chapter.
==========================================================
Article 250 : Treatment of maturity mismatches in synthetic securitisations
==========================================================
For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 249, any maturity mismatch between the credit protection which constitutes a tranche and by which the transfer of risk is achieved and the securitised exposures shall be taken into consideration as described in the following list 
==========================================================
the maturity of the securitised exposures shall be taken to be the longest maturity of any of those exposures subject to a maximum of five years. The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4
==========================================================
an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for tranches appearing pursuant to this Section with a risk weighting of 1 250 %. For all other tranches, the maturity mismatch treatment set out in Chapter 4 shall be applied in accordance with the following formula ❬where ⟨⟩ and/or RW* = risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(3)(a) and/or RWAss = risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures if they had not been securitised, calculated on a pro-rata basis and/or RWSP = risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under Article 249 if there was no maturity mismatch and/or T = maturity of the underlying exposures expressed in years and/or t = maturity of credit protection. expressed in years and/or t* = 0,25❭
==========================================================
Sub-Section 3 : Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach
==========================================================
Article 251 : Risk-weights
==========================================================
Subject to Article 252, the institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a rated securitisation or re-securitisation position by applying the relevant risk weight to the exposure value.
==========================================================
The relevant risk weight shall be the risk weight as laid down in Table 1, with which the credit assessment of the position is associated in accordance with Section 4.

==========================================================
Subject to Articles 252 to 255, the risk-weighted exposure amount of an unrated securitisation position shall be calculated by applying a risk weight of 1 250 %.
==========================================================
Article 252 : Originator and sponsor institutions
==========================================================
For an originator institution or sponsor institution, the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its securitisation positions in any one securitisation may be limited to the risk-weighted exposure amounts which would currently be calculated for the securitised exposures had they not been securitised subject to the presumed application of a 150 % risk weight to the following 
==========================================================
Article 253 : Treatment of unrated positions
==========================================================
1. For the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of an unrated securitisation position an institution may apply the weighted-average risk weight that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures, multiplied by the concentration ratio referred to in paragraph 2. For this purpose, the institution shall know the composition of the pool of securitised exposures securitised at all times.
==========================================================
2. The concentration ratio shall be equal to the sum of the nominal amounts of all the tranches divided by the sum of the nominal amounts of the tranches junior to or pari passu with the tranche in which the position is held including that tranche itself. The resulting risk weight shall not be higher than 1 250 % or lower than any risk weight applicable to a rated more senior tranche. Where the institution is unable to determine the risk weights that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2, it shall apply a risk weight of 1 250 % to the position.
==========================================================
Article 254 : Treatment of securitisation positions in a second loss tranche or better in an ABCP programme
==========================================================
Subject to the availability of a more favourable treatment for unrated liquidity facilities under Article 255 an institution may apply to securitisation positions meeting the following conditions a risk weight that is the greater of 100 % or the highest of the risk weights that would be applied to any of the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures 
==========================================================
the securitisation position shall be in a tranche which is economically in a second loss position or better in the securitisation and the first loss tranche shall provide meaningful credit enhancement to the second loss tranche

==========================================================
the securitisation position shall be held by an institution which does not hold a position in the first loss tranche
==========================================================
Article 255 : Treatment of unrated liquidity facilities
==========================================================
1. Institutions may apply a conversion factor of 50 % to the nominal amount of an unrated liquidity facility in order to determine its exposure value when the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
the liquidity facility documentation shall clearly identify and limit the circumstances under which the facility may be drawn
==========================================================
it shall not be possible for the facility to be drawn so as to provide credit support by covering losses already incurred at the time of draw and in particular not so as to provide liquidity in respect of exposures in default at the time of draw or so as to acquire assets at more than fair value

==========================================================
it shall not be possible for the facility to be drawn after all applicable credit enhancements from which the liquidity facility would benefit are exhausted
==========================================================
the facility shall include a provision that results in an automatic reduction in the amount that can be drawn by the amount of exposures that are in default, where "default" has the meaning given to it under Chapter 3, or where the pool of securitised exposures consists of rated instruments, that terminates the facility if the average quality of the pool falls below investment grade
==========================================================
The risk weight to be applied shall be the highest risk weight that would be applied to any of the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures.
==========================================================
2. To determine the exposure value of cash advance facilities, a conversion factor of 0 % may be applied to the nominal amount of a liquidity facility that is unconditionally cancellable provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are satisfied and that repayment of draws on the facility are senior to any other claims on the cash flows arising from the securitised exposures.
==========================================================
Article 256 : Additional own funds requirements for securitisations of revolving exposures with early amortisation provisions
==========================================================
1. Where there is a securitisation of revolving exposures subject to an early amortisation provision, the originator institution shall calculate an additional risk-weighted exposure amount in respect of the risk that the levels of credit risk to which it is exposed may increase following the operation of the early amortisation provision, in accordance with this Article.
==========================================================
2. The institution shall calculate a risk-weighted exposure amount in respect of the sum of the exposure values of the originator's interest and the investors' interest.
==========================================================
For securitisation structures where the securitised exposures comprise revolving and non-revolving exposures, an originator institution shall apply the treatment set out in paragraphs 3 to 6 to that portion of the underlying pool containing revolving exposures.
==========================================================
The exposure value of the originator's interest shall be the exposure value of that notional part of a pool of drawn amounts sold into a securitisation, the proportion of which in relation to the amount of the total pool sold into the structure determines the proportion of the cash flows generated by principal and interest collections and other associated amounts which are not available to make payments to those having securitisation positions in the securitisation. The originator's interest shall not be subordinate to the investors' interest. The exposure value of the investors' interest shall be the exposure value of the remaining notional part of the pool of drawn amounts.
==========================================================
The risk-weighted exposure amount in respect of the exposure value of the originator's interest shall be calculated as that for a pro rata exposure to the securitised exposures as if they had not been securitised.
==========================================================
3. Originators of the following types of securitisation are exempt from the calculation of an additional risk-weighted exposure amount in paragraph 1 
==========================================================
4. For an originator institution subject to the calculation of an additional risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with paragraph 1 the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts in respect of its positions in the investors' interest and the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under paragraph 1 shall be no greater than the greater of the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its positions in the investors' interest.
==========================================================
4. For an originator institution subject to the calculation of an additional risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with paragraph 1 the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts in respect of its positions in the investors' interest and the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under paragraph 1 shall be no greater than the greater of the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated in respect of the securitised exposures by an institution holding the exposures as if they had not been securitised in an amount equal to the investors' interest.
==========================================================
Deduction of net gains, if any, arising from the capitalisation of future income required under Article 32(1), shall be treated outside the maximum amount indicated in the preceding subparagraph.
==========================================================
5. The risk-weighted exposure amount to be calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be determined by multiplying the exposure value of the investors' interest by the product of the appropriate conversion factor as indicated in paragraphs 6 to 9 and the weighted average risk weight that would apply to the securitised exposures if the exposures had not been securitised.
==========================================================
An early amortisation provision shall be considered to be controlled where all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
6. In the case of securitisations subject to an early amortisation provision of retail exposures which are uncommitted and unconditionally cancellable without prior notice, where the early amortisation is triggered by the excess spread level falling to a specified level, institutions shall compare the three-month average excess spread level with the excess spread levels at which excess spread is required to be trapped.
==========================================================
Where the securitisation does not require excess spread to be trapped, the trapping point is deemed to be 4,5 percentage points greater than the excess spread level at which an early amortisation is triggered.
==========================================================
The conversion factor to be applied shall be determined by the level of the actual three month average excess spread in accordance with Table 2.
==========================================================
Table 2
==========================================================
 Securitisations subject to a controlled early amortisation provision Securitisations subject to a non-controlled early amortisation provision

==========================================================
Level D 20 % 100 %
==========================================================
Level E 40 % 100 %
==========================================================
Where, "Level A" refers to levels of excess spread less than 133,33 % of the trapping level of excess spread but not less than 100 % of that trapping level.
==========================================================
Where, "Level B" refers to levels of excess spread less than 100 % of the trapping level of excess spread but not less than 75 % of that trapping level.
==========================================================
Where, "Level C" refers to levels of excess spread less than 75 % of the trapping level of excess spread but not less than 50 % of that trapping level.
==========================================================
Where, "Level D" refers to levels of excess spread less than 50 % of the trapping level of excess spread but not less than 25 % of that trapping level.
==========================================================
Where, "Level E" refers to levels of excess spread less than 25 % of the trapping level of excess spread.
==========================================================
7. In the case of securitisations subject to an early amortization provision of retail exposures which are uncommitted and unconditionally cancellable without prior notice and where the early amortization is triggered by a quantitative value in respect of something other than the three months average excess spread, subject to permission by the competent authorities, institutions may apply a treatment which approximates closely to that prescribed in paragraph 6 for determining the conversion factor indicated. The competent authority shall grant permission, if the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
8. All other securitisations subject to a controlled early amortisation provision of revolving exposures shall be subject to a conversion factor of 90 %.
==========================================================
9. All other securitisations subject to a non-controlled early amortisation provision of revolving exposures shall be subject to a conversion factor of 100 %.
==========================================================
Article 257 : Credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions subject to the Standardised Approach
==========================================================
Where credit protection is obtained on a securitisation position, the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts may be amended in accordance with Chapter 4.
==========================================================
Article 258 : Reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
Where a securitisation position is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight, institutions may in accordance with Article 36(1)(k), as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 capital the exposure value of the position. For these purposes, the calculation of the exposure value may reflect eligible funded credit protection in a manner consistent with Article 257.
==========================================================
Where an originator institution makes use of this alternative, it may subtract 12.5 times the amount deducted in accordance with Article 36(1)(k) from the amount specified in Article 252 as the risk-weighted exposure amount which would currently be calculated for the securitised exposures had they not been securitised.
==========================================================
Sub-Section 4 : Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the IRB Approach
==========================================================
Article 259 : Hierarchy of methods
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall use the methods in accordance with the following hierarchy 
==========================================================
for a rated position or a position in respect of which an inferred rating may be used, the Ratings Based Method set out in Article 261 shall be used to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount
==========================================================
for an unrated position the institution may use the Supervisory Formula Method set out in Article 262 where it can produce estimates of PD, and where applicable exposure value and LGD as inputs into the Supervisory Formula Method in accordance with the requirements for the estimation of those parameters under the Internal Ratings Based approach in accordance with Section 3. An institution other than the originator institution may only use the Supervisory Formula Method subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, which shall only be granted where the institution fulfils the condition provided in the first sentence of this point
==========================================================
as an alternative to point (b) and only for unrated positions in ABCP programmes, the institution may use the Internal Assessment Approach as set out in paragraph 4 if the competent authorities have permitted it to do so
==========================================================
in all other cases, a risk weight of 1 250 % shall be assigned to securitisation positions which are unrated
==========================================================
notwithstanding point (d), and subject to the prior permission by the competent authorities, an institution may calculate the risk weight for an unrated position in an ABCP programme in accordance with Article 253 or 254, if the unrated position is not in commercial paper and falls within the scope of application of an Internal Assessment Approach for which permission is being sought. The aggregated exposure values treated by this exception shall not be material and in any case less than 10 % of the aggregate exposure values treated by the institution under the Internal Assessment Approach. The institution shall stop making use of this when the permission for the relevant Internal Assessment Approach has been refused
==========================================================
2. For the purposes of using inferred ratings, an institution shall attribute to an unrated position an inferred credit assessment equivalent to the credit assessment of a rated reference position which is the most senior position which is in all respects subordinate to the unrated securitisation position in question and meets all of the following conditions 
==========================================================
the reference positions shall be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitisation position
==========================================================
the maturity of the reference positions shall be equal to or longer than that of the unrated position in question
==========================================================
on an ongoing basis, any inferred rating shall be updated to reflect any changes in the credit assessment of the reference positions
==========================================================
3. The competent authorities shall grant institutions permission to use the "Internal Assessment Approach" as set out in paragraph 4 where all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
positions in the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme shall be rated positions
==========================================================
the internal assessment of the credit quality of the position shall reflect the publicly available assessment methodology of one or more ECAIs, for the rating of securities backed by the exposures of the type securitised
==========================================================
the ECAIs, the methodology of which shall be reflected as required by point (b), shall include those ECAIs which have provided an external rating for the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme. Quantitative elements, such as stress factors, used in assessing the position to a particular credit quality shall be at least as conservative as those used in the relevant assessment methodology of the ECAIs in question
==========================================================
in developing its internal assessment methodology the institution shall take into consideration relevant published ratings methodologies of the ECAIs that rate the commercial paper of the ABCP programme. This consideration shall be documented by the institution and updated regularly, as outlined in point (g)

the internal assessment methodology shall be used in the institution's internal risk management processes, including its decision making, management information and internal capital allocation processes
==========================================================
internal or external auditors, an ECAI, or the institution's internal credit review or risk management function shall perform regular reviews of the internal assessment process and the quality of the internal assessments of the credit quality of the institution's exposures to an ABCP programme. If the institution's internal audit, credit review, or risk management functions perform the review, then these functions shall be independent of the ABCP programme business line, as well as the customer relationship

==========================================================
the ABCP programme shall incorporate underwriting standards in the form of credit and investment guidelines. In deciding on an asset purchase, the ABCP programme administrator shall consider the type of asset being purchased, the type and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit enhancements, the loss distribution, and the legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the entity selling the assets. A credit analysis of the asset seller's risk profile shall be performed and shall include analysis of past and expected future financial performance, current market position, expected future competitiveness, leverage, cash flow, interest coverage and debt rating. In addition, a review of the seller's underwriting standards, servicing capabilities, and collection processes shall be performed

==========================================================
the ABCP programme shall have collections policies and processes that take into account the operational capability and credit quality of the servicer. The ABCP programme shall mitigate risk relating to the performance of the seller and the servicer through various methods, such as triggers based on current credit quality that would preclude commingling of funds

If the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based only on credit-related losses, then a separate reserve shall be established for dilution risk, if dilution risk is material for the particular exposure pool. In addition, in sizing the required enhancement level, the program shall review several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions, and the turnover rate of the receivables

==========================================================
4. Under the Internal Assessment Approach, the unrated position shall be assigned by the institution to one of the rating grades laid down in point (e) of paragraph 3. The position shall be attributed a derived rating the same as the credit assessments corresponding to that rating grade as laid down in point (e) of paragraph 3. Where this derived rating is, at the inception of the securitisation, at the level of investment grade or better, it shall be considered the same as an eligible credit assessment by an ECAI for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts.
==========================================================
5. Institutions which have obtained permission to use the Internal Assessment Approach shall not revert to the use of other methods unless all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
Article 260 : Maximum risk-weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
An originator institution, a sponsor institution, or other institutions which can calculate KIRB may limit the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its positions in a securitisation to that which would produce a own funds requirement under Article 92(3) equal to the sum of 8 % of the risk-weighted exposure amounts which would be produced if the securitised assets had not been securitised and were on the balance sheet of the institution plus the expected loss amounts of those exposures.
==========================================================
Article 261 : Ratings Based Method
==========================================================
1. Under the Ratings Based Method, the institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a rated securitisation or re-securitisation position by applying the relevant risk weight to the exposure value and multiplying the result by 1,06.
==========================================================
The relevant risk weight shall be the risk weight as laid down in Table 4, with which the credit assessment of the position is associated in accordance with Section 4.
==========================================================

==========================================================
The weightings in column C of Table 4 shall be applied where the securitisation position is not a re-securitisation position and where the effective number of exposures securitised is less than six.
==========================================================
For the remainder of the securitisation positions that are not re-securitisation positions, the weightings in column B shall be applied unless the position is in the most senior tranche of a securitisation, in which case the weightings in column A shall be applied.
==========================================================
For re-securitisation positions the weightings in column E shall be applied unless the re-securitisation position is in the most senior tranche of the re-securitisation and none of the underlying exposures are themselves re-securitisation exposures, in which case column D shall be applied.
==========================================================
When determining whether a tranche is the most senior, it is not required to take into consideration amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments.
==========================================================
In calculating the effective number of exposures securitised multiple exposures to one obligor shall be treated as one exposure. The effective number of exposures is calculated as:
==========================================================
where EADi represents the sum of the exposure values of all exposures to the ith obligor. If the portfolio share associated with the largest exposure, C1, is available, the institution may compute N as 1/C1.
==========================================================
2. Credit risk mitigation on securitisation positions may be recognised in accordance with Article 264(1) and (4), subject to the conditions in Article 247.
==========================================================
Article 262 : Supervisory Formula Method
==========================================================
1. Under the Supervisory Formula Method, the risk weight for a securitisation position shall be calculated as follows subject to a floor of 20 % for re-securitisation positions and 7 % for all other securitisation positions:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
S[x] = x, when x ≤ K IRBR
==========================================================
, when x > K IRBR
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
τ= 1 000;
==========================================================
ω= 20;
==========================================================
Beta [x; a, b]= the cumulative beta distribution with parameters a and b evaluated at x;
==========================================================
T= the thickness of the tranche in which the position is held, measured as the ratio of (a) the nominal amount of the tranche to (b) the sum of the nominal amounts of the exposures that have been securitised. For derivative instruments listed in Annex II, the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future credit exposure calculated in accordance with Chapter 6 shall be used in place of the nominal amount;
==========================================================
KIRBR = the ratio of (a) KIRB to (b) the sum of the exposure values of the exposures that have been securitised, and is expressed in decimal form;
==========================================================
L= the credit enhancement level, measured as the ratio of the nominal amount of all tranches subordinate to the tranche in which the position is held to the sum of the nominal amounts of the exposures that have been securitised. Capitalised future income shall not be included in the measured L. Amounts due by counterparties to derivative instruments listed in Annex II that represent tranches more junior than the tranche in question may be measured at their current replacement cost, without the potential future credit exposures, in calculating the enhancement level;
==========================================================
N= the effective number of exposures calculated in accordance with Article 261. In the case of re-securitisations, the institution shall look at the number of securitisation exposures in the pool and not the number of underlying exposures in the original pools from which the underlying securitisation exposures stem;
==========================================================
ELGD= the exposure-weighted average loss-given-default, calculated as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
LGDi = the average LGD associated with all exposures to the ith obligor, where LGD is determined in accordance with Chapter 3. In the case of resecuritisation, an LGD of 100 % shall be applied to the securitised positions. When default and dilution risk for purchased receivables are treated in an aggregate manner within a securitisation, the LGDi input shall be constructed as a weighted average of the LGD for credit risk and the 75 % LGD for dilution risk. The weights shall be the stand-alone own funds charges for credit risk and dilution risk respectively.
==========================================================
2. Where the nominal amount of the largest securitised exposure, C1, is no more than 3 % of the sum of the nominal amount of the securitised exposures, then, for the purposes of the Supervisory Formula Method, the institution may set LGD= 50 % in the case of securitisations, which are not re-securitisations, and N equal to either of the following:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
Cm = the ratio of the sum of the nominal amounts of the largest "m" exposures to the sum of the nominal amounts of the exposures securitised. The level of "m" may be set by the institution.
==========================================================
For securitisations in which materially all securitised exposures are retail exposures, institutions may, subject to permission by the competent authority, use the Supervisory Formula Method using the simplifications h=0 and v=0, provided that the effective number of exposures is not low and that the exposures are not highly concentrated.
==========================================================
3. The competent authorities shall keep EBA informed about the use institutions make of paragraph 2. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines.

==========================================================
Article 263 : Liquidity Facilities
==========================================================
1. For the purposes of determining the exposure value of an unrated securitisation position in the form of cash advance facilities, a conversion factor of 0 % may be applied to the nominal amount of a liquidity facility that meets the conditions set out in Article 255(2).
==========================================================
2. When it is not possible for the institution to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for the securitised exposures as if they had not been securitised, an institution may, on an exceptional basis and subject to the permission of the competent authorities, temporarily apply the method set out in paragraph 3 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for an unrated securitisation position in the form of liquidity facility that meets the conditions in Article 255(1). Institutions shall notify the use they make of the first sentence to the competent authorities, together with its reasons and the intended time period of use.

The calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts shall, in general, be deemed not to be possible if an inferred rating, the Internal Assessment Approach and the Supervisory Formula Approach are not at the institution's disposal.
==========================================================
3. The highest risk weight that would be applied under Chapter 2 to any of the securitised exposures, had they not been securitised, may be applied to the securitisation position represented by a liquidity facility that meets the conditions in Article 255(1). To determine the exposure value of the position a conversion factor of 100 % shall be applied.
==========================================================
Article 264 : Credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions subject to the IRB Approach
==========================================================
1. Where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Ratings Based Method, the exposure value or the risk-weight for a securitisation position in respect of which credit protection has been obtained may be amended in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2.
==========================================================
2. In the case of full credit protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, the institution shall determine the "effective risk weight" of the position. It shall do this by dividing the risk-weighted exposure amount of the position by the exposure value of the position and multiplying the result by 100.
==========================================================
2. In the case of full credit protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, in the case of funded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the funded protection-adjusted exposure amount of the position (E*), as calculated under Chapter 4 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the securitisation position to be E, by the effective risk weight.
==========================================================
2. In the case of full credit protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, in the case of unfunded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch and maturity mismatch (GA) in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 by the risk weight of the protection provider; and adding this to the amount arrived at by multiplying the amount of the securitisation position minus GA by the effective risk weight.
==========================================================
3. In the case of partial protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, if the credit risk mitigation covers the first loss or losses on a proportional basis on the securitisation position, the institution may apply paragraph 2.
==========================================================
3. In the case of partial protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, in other cases, the institution shall treat the securitisation position as two or more positions with the uncovered portion being considered the position with the lower credit quality. For the purposes of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount for this position, the provisions in Article 262 shall apply subject to the adjustment of T to e* in the case of funded credit protection and to T-g in the case of unfunded credit protection, where e* denotes the ratio of E* to the total notional amount of the underlying pool, where E* is the adjusted exposure amount of the securitisation position calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the securitisation position to be E; and g is the ratio of the nominal amount of credit protection, adjusted for any currency or maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4, to the sum of the exposure amounts of the securitised exposures. In the case of unfunded credit protection the risk weight of the protection provider shall be applied to that portion of the position not falling within the adjusted value of T.
==========================================================
4. Where, in the case of unfunded credit protection, competent authorities have granted the institution permission to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Chapter 3, the risk weight g of exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Article 235 shall be determined as specified in Chapter 3.
==========================================================
Article 265 : Additional own funds requirements for securitisations of revolving exposures with early amortisation provisions
==========================================================
1. In addition to the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its securitisation positions, an originator institution shall calculate a risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with the methodology set out in Article 256 when it sells revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision.
==========================================================
2. By way of derogation from Article 256, the exposure value of the originators interest shall be the sum of the following items 
==========================================================
The originator's interest shall not be subordinate to the investors' interest.
==========================================================
The exposure value of the Investors' interest shall be the exposure value of the notional part of the pool of drawn amounts not falling within point (a) plus the exposure value of that part of the pool of undrawn amounts of credit lines, the drawn amounts of which have been sold into the securitisation, not falling within point (b).
==========================================================
3. The risk-weighted exposure amount in respect of the exposure value of the originator's interest in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 2 shall be calculated as that for a pro-rata exposure to the securitised drawn amounts exposures as if they had not been securitised and a pro rata exposure to the undrawn amounts of the credit lines, the drawn amounts of which have been sold into the securitisation.
==========================================================
Article 266 : Reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts
==========================================================
1. The risk-weighted exposure amount of a securitisation position to which a 1 250 % risk weight is assigned may be reduced by 12,5 times the amount of any specific credit risk adjustments treated in accordance with Article 110 made by the institution in respect of the securitised exposures. To the extent that specific credit adjustments are taken account of for this purpose they shall not be taken account of for the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 159.
==========================================================
2. The risk-weighted exposure amount of a securitisation position may be reduced by 12,5 times the amount of any specific credit risk adjustments treated in accordance with Article 110 made by the institution in respect of the position.
==========================================================
3. As provided in Article 36(1)(k) in respect of a securitisation position in respect of which a 1 250 % risk weight applies, institutions may, as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from own funds the exposure value of the position subject to the following 
==========================================================
4. Where an institution makes use of the option in paragraph 3 it may subtract 12,5 times the amount deducted in accordance with that paragraph from the amount specified in Article 260 as the amount to which the risk-weighted exposure amount in respect of its positions in a securitisation may be limited.

==========================================================
Article 268 : Requirements to be met by the credit assessments of ECAIs
==========================================================
For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Section 3, institutions shall only use a credit assessment of an ECAI if the following conditions are met

==========================================================
Article 272 : Definitions
==========================================================
For the purposes of this Chapter and of Title VI of this Part, the following definitions shall apply:
==========================================================
 General terms
==========================================================

==========================================================
 Transaction types
==========================================================
(2) "long settlement transactions" means transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date specified by contract that is later than the market standard for this particular type of transaction or five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction, whichever is earlier;
==========================================================
(3) "margin lending transactions" means transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that are secured by collateral in the form of securities;

 Netting set, hedging sets, and related terms
==========================================================
(4) "netting set" means a group of transactions between an institution and a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recognised under Section 7 and Chapter 4.
==========================================================
Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement which is recognised under Section 7 shall be treated as its own netting set for the purposes of this Chapter.
==========================================================
Under the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6, all netting sets with a single counterparty may be treated as a single netting set if negative simulated market values of the individual netting sets are set to 0 in the estimation of expected exposure (hereinafter referred to as "EE");
==========================================================
(5) "risk position" means a risk number that is assigned to a transaction under the Standardised Method set out in Section5 following a predetermined algorithm;
==========================================================

==========================================================
(7) "margin agreement" means an agreement or provisions of an agreement under which one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an exposure of that second counterparty to the first counterparty exceeds a specified level;
==========================================================
(8) "margin threshold" means the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding before one party has the right to call for collateral;
==========================================================
(9) "margin period of risk" means the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until the transactions are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged;
==========================================================
(10) "effective maturity under the Internal Model Method for a netting set with maturity greater than one year" means the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate of return, divided by the sum of expected exposure over one year in a netting set discounted at the risk-free rate.
==========================================================
This effective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year;
==========================================================
(11) "cross-product netting" means the inclusion of transactions of different product categories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross-Product Netting rules set out in this Chapter;

==========================================================
 Exposure measures and adjustments
==========================================================
(17) "current exposure" means the larger of zero and the market value of a transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in insolvency or liquidation;
==========================================================
(18) "peak exposure" means a high percentile of the distribution of exposures at particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set;
==========================================================
(19) "expected exposure" (hereinafter referred to as "EE") means the average of the distribution of exposures at a particular future date before the longest maturity transaction in the netting set matures;
==========================================================
(20) "effective expected exposure at a specific date" (hereinafter referred to as "Effective EE") means the maximum expected exposure that occurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as the greater of the expected exposure at that date or the effective expected exposure at any prior date;
==========================================================
(21) "expected positive exposure" (hereinafter referred to as "EPE") means the weighted average over time of expected exposures, where the weights are the proportion of the entire time period that an individual expected exposure represents.

==========================================================
 CCR related risks
==========================================================
(23) "rollover risk" means the amount by which EPE is understated when future transactions with a counterparty are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis.
==========================================================
The additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculation of EPE;
==========================================================
(24) "counterparty" for the purposes of Section 7 means any legal or natural person that enters into a netting agreement, and has the contractual capacity to do so;
==========================================================

(26) "payment leg" means the payment agreed in an OTC derivative transaction with a linear risk profile which stipulates the exchange of a financial instrument for a payment.
==========================================================
In the case of transactions that stipulate the exchange of payment against payment, those two payment legs shall consist of the contractually agreed gross payments, including the notional amount of the transaction.
==========================================================
Section 2 : Methods for calculating the exposure value
==========================================================
Article 273 : Methods for calculating the exposure value
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall determine the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 in accordance with this Article.
==========================================================
An institution which is not eligible for the treatment set out in Article 94 shall not use the method set out in Section 4. To determine the exposure value for the contracts listed in point 3 of Annex II an institution shall not use the method set out in Section 4. Institutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis but shall be permitted to use in combination methods set out in Sections 3 and 5 when one of the methods is used for the cases set out in Article 282(6).
==========================================================
2. Where permitted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1) and (2), an institution may determine the exposure value for the following items using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 
==========================================================
3. When an institution purchases protection through a credit derivative against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty risk exposure, it may calculate its own funds requirement for the hedged exposure in accordance with either of the following 
==========================================================
The exposure value for CCR for those credit derivatives shall be zero, unless an institution applies the approach (ii) in point (h) of Article 299(2).
==========================================================
4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, an institution may choose consistently to include for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk all credit derivatives not included in the trading book and purchased as protection against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty credit risk exposure where the credit protection is recognised under this Regulation.
==========================================================
5. Where credit default swaps sold by an institution are treated by an institution as credit protection provided by that institution and are subject to own funds requirement for credit risk of the underlying for the full notional amount, their exposure value for the purposes of CCR in the non-trading book shall be zero.
==========================================================
6. Under all methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.
==========================================================
For a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of CVA for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds under Article 33(1)(c).
==========================================================
7. Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of such positions.
==========================================================
8. For the methods set out in Sections 3 and 4, the institution shall adopt a consistent methodology for determining the notional amount for different product types, and shall ensure that the notional amount to be taken into account provides an appropriate measure of the risk inherent in the contract. Where the contract provides for a multiplication of cash flows, the notional amount shall be adjusted by an institution to take into account the effects of the multiplication on the risk structure of that contract.
==========================================================
For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, institutions shall treat transactions where specific wrong way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291(2), (4), (5) and (6) as appropriate.
==========================================================
Section 3 : Mark – to – market Method
==========================================================
Article 274 : Mark-to-market Method
==========================================================
1. In order to determine the current replacement cost of all contracts with positive values, institutions shall attach the current market values to the contracts.
==========================================================
2. In order to determine the potential future credit exposure, institutions shall multiply the notional amounts or underlying values, as applicable, by the percentages in Table 1 and in accordance with the following principles 
==========================================================
contracts which do not fall within one of the five categories indicated in Table 1 shall be treated as contracts concerning commodities other than precious metals
==========================================================
for contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the percentages shall be multiplied by the number of remaining payments still to be made in accordance with the contract
==========================================================
for contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the contract is zero on those specified dates, the residual maturity shall be equal to the time until the next reset date. In the case of interest-rate contracts that meet those criteria and have a remaining maturity of over one year, the percentage shall be no lower than 0,5 %
==========================================================
Table 1
==========================================================
Residual maturity Interest-rate contracts Contracts concerning foreign-exchange rates and gold Contracts concerning equities Contracts concerning precious metals except gold Contracts concerning commodities other than precious metals
==========================================================
One year or less 0 % 1 % 6 % 7 % 10 %
==========================================================
Over one year, not exceeding five years 0,5 % 5 % 8 % 7 % 12 %
==========================================================
Over five years 1,5 % 7,5 % 10 % 8 % 15 %
==========================================================
3. For contracts relating to commodities other than gold, which are referred to in point 3 of Annex II, an institution may, as an alternative to applying the percentages in Table 1, apply the percentages in Table 2 provided that that institution follows the extended maturity ladder approach set out in Article 361 for those contracts.
==========================================================

==========================================================
Over five years 7,5 % 8 % 9 % 10 %
==========================================================
4. The sum of current replacement cost and potential future credit exposure is the exposure value.
==========================================================
Section 4 : Original Exposure Method
==========================================================
Article 275 : Original Exposure Method
==========================================================
1. The exposure value is the notional amount of each instrument multiplied by the percentages set out in Table 3.
==========================================================
Table 3
==========================================================
Original maturity Interest-rate contracts Contracts concerning foreign-exchange rates and gold
==========================================================

==========================================================
Additional allowance for each additional year 1 % 3 %
==========================================================
2. For calculating the exposure value of interest-rate contracts, an institution may choose to use either the original or residual maturity.
==========================================================
Section 5 : Standardised Method
==========================================================
Article 276 : Standardised Method
==========================================================
1. Institutions may use the Standardised Method (hereinafter referred to as "SM") only for calculating the exposure value for OTC derivatives and long settlement transactions.
==========================================================
2. When applying the SM, institutions shall calculate the exposure value separately for each netting set, net of collateral, as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
CMV = current market value of the portfolio of transactions within the netting set with a counterparty gross of collateral, where:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
CMVi = the current market value of transaction i;
==========================================================
CMC = the current market value of the collateral assigned to the netting set, where:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
CMCl = the current market value of collateral l;
==========================================================
i = index designating transaction;
==========================================================
l = index designating collateral;
==========================================================
j = index designating hedging set category;
==========================================================
The hedging sets for this purpose correspond to risk factors for which risk positions of opposite sign can be offset to yield a net risk position on which the exposure measure is then based.
==========================================================
RPTij = risk position from transaction i with respect to hedging set j;
==========================================================
RPClj = risk position from collateral l with respect to hedging set j;
==========================================================
CCRMj = CCR Multiplier set out in Table 5 with respect to hedging set j;
==========================================================
β = 1,4.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of the calculation under paragraph 2, eligible collateral received from a counterparty shall have a positive sign and collateral posted to a counterparty shall have a negative sign.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of the calculation under paragraph 2, only collateral that is eligible under Article 197, Article 198 and Article 299(2)(d) shall be used for the SM.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of the calculation under paragraph 2, an institution may disregard the interest rate risk from payment legs with a remaining maturity of less than one year.
==========================================================
3. For the purposes of the calculation under paragraph 2, an institution may treat transactions that consist of two payment legs that are denominated in the same currency as a single aggregate transaction. The treatment for payment legs applies to the aggregate transaction.
==========================================================
Article 277 : Transactions with a linear risk profile
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall map transactions with a linear risk profile to risk positions in accordance with the following provisions 
==========================================================
transactions with a linear risk profile with equities (including equity indices), gold, other precious metals or other commodities as the underlying shall be mapped to a risk position in the respective equity (or equity index) or commodity and an interest rate risk position for the payment leg
==========================================================
transactions with a linear risk profile with a debt instrument as the underlying instrument shall be mapped to an interest rate risk position for the debt instrument and another interest rate risk position for the payment leg
==========================================================
transactions with a linear risk profile that stipulate the exchange of payment against payment, including foreign exchange forwards, shall be mapped to an interest rate risk position for each of the payment legs
==========================================================
Where, under a transaction mentioned in point (a), (b) or (c), a payment leg or the underlying debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, that payment leg or underlying instrument shall also be mapped to a risk position in that currency.
==========================================================
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the size of a risk position from a transaction with linear risk profile shall be the effective notional value (market price multiplied by quantity) of the underlying financial instruments or commodities converted to the institution's domestic currency by multiplication with the relevant exchange rate, except for debt instruments.
==========================================================
3. For debt instruments and for payment legs, the size of the risk position shall be the effective notional value of the outstanding gross payments (including the notional amount) converted to the currency of the home Member State, multiplied by the modified duration of the debt instrument or payment leg, as the case may be.
==========================================================
4. The size of a risk position from a credit default swap shall be the notional value of the reference debt instrument multiplied by the remaining maturity of the credit default swap.
==========================================================
Article 278 : Transactions with a non-linear risk profile
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall determine the size of the risk positions for transactions with a non-linear risk profile in accordance with the following paragraphs.
==========================================================
2. The size of a risk position from an OTC derivative with a non-linear risk profile, including options and swaptions, of which the underlying is not a debt instrument or a payment leg shall be equal to the delta equivalent effective notional value of the financial instrument that underlies the transaction in accordance with Article 280(1).
==========================================================
3. The size of a risk position from an OTC derivative with a non-linear risk profile, including options and swaptions, of which the underlying is a debt instrument or a payment leg, shall be equal to the delta equivalent effective notional value of the financial instrument or payment leg multiplied by the modified duration of the debt instrument or payment leg, as the case may be.
==========================================================
Article 279 : Treatment of Collateral
==========================================================
For the determination of risk positions, institutions shall treat collateral as described in the following list 
==========================================================
collateral received from a counterparty shall be treated as a claim on the counterparty under a derivative contract (long position) that is due on the day the determination is made
==========================================================
collateral it has posted with the counterparty shall be treated as an obligation to the counterparty (short position) that is due on the day the determination is made
==========================================================
Article 280 : Calculation of risk positions
==========================================================
1. An institution shall determine the size and sign of a risk position as described in the following list 
==========================================================
for all instruments other than debt instruments ❬as the effective notional value in the case of a transaction with a linear risk profile and/or as the delta equivalent notional value and/or , in the case of a transaction with a non-linear risk profile and/or where ⟨Pref = price of the underlying instrument, expressed in the reference currency and/or V = value of the financial instrument (in the case of an option, the value is the option price) and/or p = price of the underlying instrument, expressed in the same currency as V and/or for debt instruments and the payment legs of all transactions ⟨as the effective notional value multiplied by the modified duration in the case of a transaction with a linear risk profile and/or as the delta equivalent in notional value multiplied by the modified duration⟩ and/or , in the case of a transaction with a non-linear risk profile and/or where ⟨⟩ and/or V = value of the financial instrument (in the case of an option this is the option price) and/or r = interest rate level and/or If V is denominated in a currency other than the reference currency, the derivative shall be converted into the reference currency by multiplication with the relevant exchange rate⟩❭
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall group the risk positions into hedging sets. The absolute value amount of the sum of the resulting risk positions shall be calculated for each hedging set. The net risk position shall be the result of that calculation and shall be calculated for the purposes of Article 276(2) as follows:
==========================================================
Article 281 : Interest rate risk positions
==========================================================
1. In order to calculate interest rate risk position, institutions shall apply the following provisions.
==========================================================
2. For interest rate risk positions from the following 
==========================================================
to which in each case a capital charge of 1,60 % or less applies in accordance with Table 1 of Article 336, institutions shall assign those positions to one of the six hedging sets for each currency set out in Table 4.
==========================================================

==========================================================
>1 ≤ 5 years > 5 years
==========================================================
3. For interest rate risk positions from underlying debt instruments or payment legs for which the interest rate is linked to a reference interest rate that represents a general market interest level, the remaining maturity shall be the length of the time interval up to the next re-adjustment of the interest rate. In all other cases, it shall be the remaining life of the underlying debt instrument or, in the case of a payment leg, the remaining life of the transaction.
==========================================================
Article 282 : Hedging sets
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall establish hedging sets in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.
==========================================================
2. There shall be one hedging set for each issuer of a reference debt instrument that underlies a credit default swap.
==========================================================
N-th to default basket credit default swaps shall be treated as described in the following list 
==========================================================
the size of a risk position in a reference debt instrument in a basket underlying an n-th to default credit default swap shall be the effective notional value of the reference debt instrument, multiplied by the modified duration of the n-th to default derivative with respect to a change in the credit spread of the reference debt instrument
==========================================================
there shall be one hedging set for each reference debt instrument in a basket underlying a given "nth to default" credit default swap. Risk positions from different n-th to default credit default swaps shall not be included in the same hedging set
==========================================================
the CCR multiplier applicable to each hedging set created for one of the reference debt instruments of an n-th to default derivative shall be as follows ❬0,3 % for reference debt instruments that have a credit assessment from a recognised ECAI equivalent to credit quality step 1 to 3 and/or 0,6 % for other debt instruments❭
==========================================================
3. For interest rate risk positions from money deposits that are posted with a counterparty as collateral when that counterparty does not have debt obligations of low specific risk outstanding.
==========================================================
3. For interest rate risk positions from underlying debt instruments, to which according to Table 1 of Article 336 a capital charge of more than 1,60 % applies.
==========================================================
There shall be one hedging set for each issuer.
==========================================================
When a payment leg emulates such a debt instrument, there shall also be one hedging set for each issuer of the reference debt instrument.
==========================================================
An institution may assign risk positions that arise from debt instruments of a particular issuer, or from reference debt instruments of the same issuer that are emulated by payment legs, or that underlie a credit default swap, to the same hedging set.
==========================================================
4. Underlying financial instruments other than debt instruments shall be assigned to the same hedging sets only if they are identical or similar instruments. In all other cases they shall be assigned to separate hedging sets.
==========================================================
For the purposes of this paragraph institutions shall determine whether underlying instruments are similar in accordance with the following principles 
==========================================================
for equities, the underlying is similar if it is issued by the same issuer. An equity index shall be treated as a separate issuer
==========================================================
for precious metals, the underlying is similar if it is the same metal. A precious metal index shall be treated as a separate precious metal
==========================================================
for electric power, the underlying is similar if the delivery rights and obligations refer to the same peak or off-peak load time interval within any 24-hour interval
==========================================================
for commodities, the underlying is similar if it is the same commodity. A commodity index shall be treated as a separate commodity
==========================================================
5. The CCR multipliers (hereinafter referred to as "CCRM") for the different hedging set categories are set out in the following table:

==========================================================
10. Underlying instruments of OTC derivatives that are not in any of the above categories 10 %
==========================================================
Underlying instruments of OTC derivatives, as referred to in point 10 of Table 5, shall be assigned to separate individual hedging sets for each category of underlying instrument.
==========================================================
6. For transactions with a non-linear risk profile or for payment legs and transactions with debt instruments as underlying for which the institution cannot determine the delta or the modified duration, as the case may be, with an instrument model that the competent authority has approved for the purposes of determining the own funds requirements for market risk, the competent authority shall either determine the size of the risk positions and the applicable CCRMjs conservatively, or require the institution to use the method set out in Section 3. Netting shall not be recognised (that is, the exposure value shall be determined as if there were a netting set that comprises just an individual transaction).
==========================================================
7. An institution shall have internal procedures to verify that, prior to including a transaction in a hedging set, the transaction is covered by a legally enforceable netting contract that meets the requirements set out in Section 7.

Section 6 : Internal Model Method
==========================================================
Article 283 : Permission to use the Internal Model Method
==========================================================
1. Provided that the competent authorities are satisfied that the requirement in paragraph 2 have been met by an institution, they shall permit that institution to use the Internal Model Method (IMM) to calculate the exposure value for any of the following transactions 
==========================================================
Where an institution is permitted to use the IMM to calculate exposure value for any of the transactions mentioned in points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph, it may also use the IMM for the transactions in Article 273(2)(e).
==========================================================
Notwithstanding the third subparagraph of Article 273(1), an institution may choose not to apply this method to exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. In such case, an institution shall apply one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 5 to these exposures where the relevant requirements for each approach are met.
==========================================================
2. Competent authorities shall permit institutions to use IMM for the calculations referred to in paragraph 1 only if the institution has demonstrated that it complies with the requirements set out in this Section, and the competent authorities verified that the systems for the management of CCR maintained by the institution are sound and properly implemented.
==========================================================
3. The competent authorities may permit institutions for a limited period to implement the IMM sequentially across different transaction types. During this period of sequential implementation institutions may use the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 for transaction type for which they do not use the IMM.
==========================================================
4. For all OTC derivative transactions and for long settlement transactions for which an institution has not received permission under paragraph 1 to use the IMM, the institution shall use the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5.
==========================================================
Those methods may be used in combination on a permanent basis within a group. Within an institution those methods may be used in combination only where one of the methods is used for the cases set out in Article 282(6)
==========================================================
5. An institution which is permitted in accordance with paragraph 1 to use the IMM shall not revert to the use of the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 unless it is permitted by the competent authority to do so. Competent authorities shall give such permission if the institution demonstrates good cause.
==========================================================
6. If an institution ceases to comply with the requirements laid down in this Section, it shall notify the competent authority and do one of the following 
==========================================================
SUBJ: this institution ceases
VERB: notify
DEST: the competent authority
FREQ: very likely reoccurring
::::: ARGM-TMP: if an institution ceases to comply with the requirements laid down in this section
==========================================================
Article 284 : Exposure value
==========================================================
1. Where an institution is permitted, in accordance with Article 283(1), to use the IMM to calculate the exposure value of some or all transactions mentioned in that paragraph, it shall measure the exposure value of those transactions at the level of the netting set.
==========================================================
The model used by the institution for that purpose shall specify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to joint changes in relevant market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates.
==========================================================
The model used by the institution for that purpose shall calculate the exposure value for the netting set at each of the future dates on the basis of the joint changes in the market variables.
==========================================================
2. In order for the model to capture the effects of margining, the model of the collateral value shall meet the quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for the IMM model in accordance with this Section and the institution may include in its forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set only eligible financial collateral as referred to in Articles 197 and 198 and points (c) and (d) of Article 299(2).
==========================================================
3. The own funds requirement for counterparty credit risk with respect to the CCR exposures to which an institution applies the IMM, shall be the higher of the following 
==========================================================
4. Except for counterparties identified as having Specific Wrong-Way Risk that fall within the scope of Article 291(4) and (5), institutions shall calculate the exposure value as the product of alpha (α) times Effective EPE, as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
α = 1.4, unless competent authorities require a higher α or permit institutions to use their own estimates in accordance with paragraph 9;
==========================================================
Effective EPE shall be calculated by estimating expected exposure (EEt) as the average exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across possible future values of relevant market risk factors.
==========================================================
The model shall estimate EE at a series of future dates t1, t2, t3, etc.
==========================================================
5. Effective EE shall be calculated recursively as:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
 the current date is denoted as t0;
==========================================================
 Effective EEt0 equals current exposure.
==========================================================
6. Effective EPE is the average Effective EE during the first year of future exposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature within less than one year, EPE shall be the average of EE until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE shall be calculated as a weighted average of Effective EE:
==========================================================
where the weights allow for the case when future exposure is calculated at dates that are not equally spaced over time.
==========================================================
7. Institutions shall calculate EE or peak exposure measures on the basis of a distribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non-normality of the distribution of exposures.
==========================================================
8. An institution may use a measure of the distribution calculated by the model that is more conservative than α multiplied by Effective EPE as calculated in accordance with the equation in paragraph 4 for every counterparty.
==========================================================
9. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, competent authorities may permit institutions to use their own estimates of alpha, where alpha shall equal the ratio of internal capital from a full simulation of CCR exposure across counterparties (numerator) and internal capital based on EPE (denominator).
==========================================================
9. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, competent authorities may permit institutions to use their own estimates of alpha, where in the denominator, EPE shall be used as if it were a fixed outstanding amount.
==========================================================
When estimated in accordance with this paragraph, alpha shall be no lower than 1.2.
==========================================================
10. For the purposes of an estimate of alpha under paragraph 9, an institution shall ensure that the numerator and denominator are calculated in a manner consistent with the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used to estimate α shall be based on the institution's internal capital approach, be well documented and be subject to independent validation. In addition, an institution shall review its estimates of alpha on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. An institution shall also assess the model risk.

==========================================================
12. In supervising the use of estimates under paragraph 9, competent authorities shall have regard to the significant variation in estimates of alpha that arises from the potential for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present.
==========================================================
13. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint modelling of market and credit risk shall be conditioned on the credit risk factor to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn.
==========================================================
Article 285 : Exposure value for netting sets subject to a margin agreement
==========================================================
1. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and daily mark-to-market valuation, an institution may use one of the following EPE measures 
==========================================================
effective EPE, without taking into account any collateral held or posted by way of margin plus any collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily valuation and margining process or current exposure
==========================================================
an add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of ❬the current exposure including all collateral currently held or posted, other than collateral called or in dispute and/or the largest net exposure, including collateral under the margin agreement, that would not trigger a collateral call. This amount shall reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement❭
==========================================================
if the model captures the effects of margining when estimating EE, the institution may, subject to the permission of the competent authority, use the model's EE measure directly in the equation in Article 284(5). Competent authorities shall grant such permission only if they verify that the model properly captures the effects of margining when estimating EE
==========================================================
For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall calculate the add-on as the expected positive change of the mark-to-market value of the transactions during the margin period of risk. Changes in the value of collateral shall be reflected using the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with Section 3 of Chapter 4 or the own estimates of volatility adjustments of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, but no collateral payments shall be assumed during the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk is subject to the minimum periods set out in paragraphs 2 to 5.
==========================================================
2. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling the exposure value with margin agreements shall not be less than 5 business days for netting sets consisting only of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions and margin lending transactions.
==========================================================
2. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling the exposure value with margin agreements shall not be less than 10 business days for all other netting sets.
==========================================================
3. Points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 shall be subject to the following exceptions 
==========================================================
for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5 000 at any point during a quarter, the margin period of risk for the following quarter shall not be less than 20 business days. This exception shall not apply to institutions' trade exposures
==========================================================
for netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the margin period of risk shall not be less than 20 business days
==========================================================
An institution shall determine whether collateral is illiquid or whether OTC derivatives cannot be easily replaced in the context of stressed market conditions, characterised by the absence of continuously active markets where a counterparty would, within two days or fewer, obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative).
==========================================================
An institution shall consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution would be able to replace those trades or securities.
==========================================================
4. If an institution has been involved in more than two margin call disputes on a particular netting set over the immediately preceding two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk under paragraphs 2 and 3, the institution shall use a margin period of risk that is at least double the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters.
==========================================================
5. For re-margining with a periodicity of N days, the margin period of risk shall be at least equal to the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3, F, plus N days minus one day. That is:
==========================================================
6. If the internal model includes the effect of margining on changes in the market value of the netting set, an institution shall model collateral, other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, jointly with the exposure in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions.
==========================================================
7. If an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure, it shall not recognise in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions the effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, unless it uses either volatility adjustments that meet the standards of the financial collateral comprehensive method with own volatility adjustments estimates or the standard supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with Chapter 4.
==========================================================
8. An institution using the IMM shall ignore in its models the effect of a reduction of the exposure value due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.
==========================================================
Article 286 : Management of CCR – Policies, processes and systems

Article 289 : Use test
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of exposures generated by the model used to calculate effective EPE is closely integrated into the day-to-day CCR management process of the institution, and that the output of the model is taken into account in the process of credit approval, CCR management, internal capital allocation and corporate governance.
==========================================================
2. The institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been using a model to calculate the distribution of exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets, broadly, the requirements set out in this Section for at least one year prior to permission to use the IMM by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283.

FREQ: very likely reoccurring
==========================================================
3. The model used to generate a distribution of exposures to CCR shall be part of the CCR management framework required by Article 286. This framework shall include the measurement of usage of credit lines, aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and internal capital allocation.
==========================================================
4. In addition to EPE, an institution shall measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral. The use test is satisfied if an institution uses other CCR measures, such as peak exposure, based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same model to compute EPE.
==========================================================
5. An institution shall have the systems capability to estimate EE daily if necessary, unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authorities that its exposures to CCR warrant less frequent calculation. The institution shall estimate EE along a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts and in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposures.

==========================================================
6. Exposure shall be measured, monitored and controlled over the life of all contracts in the netting set and not only to the one-year horizon. The institution shall have procedures in place to identify and control the risks for counterparties where the exposure rises beyond the one-year horizon. The forecast increase in exposure shall be an input into the institution's internal capital model.

Article 290 : Stress testing
==========================================================
1. An institution shall have a comprehensive stress testing programme for CCR, including for use in assessment of own funds requirements for CCR, which complies with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10.
==========================================================
2. It shall identify possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on an institution's credit exposures and assess the institution's ability to withstand such changes.
==========================================================

==========================================================
3. The stress measures under the programme shall be compared against risk limits and considered by the institution as part of the process set out in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
==========================================================
4. The programme shall comprehensively capture trades and aggregate exposures across all forms of counterparty credit risk at the level of specific counterparties in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing.
==========================================================
5. It shall provide for at least monthly exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors such as interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices for all counterparties of the institution, in order to identify, and enable the institution when necessary to reduce outsized concentrations in specific directional risks. Exposure stress testing -including single factor, multifactor and material non-directional risks- and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness shall be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group and aggregate institution-wide CCR levels.

7. The severity of the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be sufficiently severe to capture historical extreme market environments and extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The stress tests shall evaluate the impact of such shocks on own funds, own funds requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations the testing programme shall also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability.
==========================================================
8. The programme shall include provision, where appropriate, for reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes. Reverse stress testing shall account for the impact of material non-linearity in the portfolio.
==========================================================
9. The results of the stress testing under the programme shall be reported regularly, at least on a quarterly basis, to senior management. The reports and analysis of the results shall cover the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends.

Article 291 : Wrong-Way Risk
==========================================================
1. For the purposes of this Article, "General Wrong-Way risk" arises when the likelihood of default by counterparties is positively correlated with general market risk factors.
==========================================================
1. For the purposes of this Article, "Specific Wrong-Way risk" arises when future exposure to a specific counterparty is positively correlated with the counterparty's PD due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty. An institution shall be considered to be exposed to Specific Wrong-Way risk if the future exposure to a specific counterparty is expected to be high when the counterparty's probability of a default is also high.
==========================================================
2. An institution shall give due consideration to exposures that give rise to a significant degree of Specific and General Wrong-Way Risk.
==========================================================
3. In order to identify General Wrong-Way Risk, an institution shall design stress testing and scenario analyses to stress risk factors that are adversely related to counterparty credit worthiness. Such testing shall address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. An institution shall monitor General Wrong Way Risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are relevant to the business.

5. Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for CCR in relation to transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified and where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the issuer of the underlying of the OTC derivative or the underlying of the transactions referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 273(2)), in accordance with the following principles 
==========================================================
the instruments where Specific Wrong-Way risk exists shall not be included in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty, and shall each be treated as a separate netting set
==========================================================
within any such separate netting set, for single-name credit default swaps the exposure value equals the full expected loss in the value of the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments based on the assumption that the underlying issuer is in liquidation
==========================================================
LGD for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 3 shall be 100 % for such swap transactions
==========================================================
for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 2, the applicable risk weight shall be that of an unsecured transaction
==========================================================
for all other transactions referencing a single name in any such separate netting set, the calculation of the exposure value shall be consistent with the assumption of a jump-to-default of those underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty. For transactions referencing a basket of names or index, the jump-to-default of the respective underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty, shall be applied, if material
==========================================================
to the extent that this uses existing market risk calculations for own funds requirements for incremental default and migration risk as set out in Title IV, Chapter 5, Section 4 that already contain an LGD assumption, the LGD in the formula used shall be 100 %

Article 292 : Integrity of the modelling process
==========================================================

==========================================================
the model shall reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete, and conservative fashion
==========================================================
those terms shall include at least contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements

==========================================================
2. Current market data shall be used to determine current exposures. An institution may calibrate its EPE model using either historic market data or market implied data to establish parameters of the underlying stochastic processes, such as drift, volatility and correlation. If an institution uses historical data, it shall use at least three years of such data. The data shall be updated at least quarterly, and more frequently if necessary to reflect market conditions.
==========================================================
To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, an institution shall calibrate Effective EPE using either three years of data that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of its counterparties or market implied data from such a period of stress.
==========================================================
The requirements in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be applied by the institution for that purpose.
==========================================================
3. An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority, at least quarterly, that the stress period used for the calculation under this paragraph coincides with a period of increased credit default swap or other credit (such as loan or corporate bond) spreads for a representative selection of its counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, it shall map that counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types.

4. The EPE model for all counterparties shall use data, either historic or implied, that include the data from the stressed credit period and shall use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the EPE model to current data.
==========================================================
5. To evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for EEPE, an institution shall create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the main risk factors to which the institution is exposed. The exposure to these benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) a stress methodology, based on current market values and model parameters calibrated to stressed market conditions, and (b) the exposure generated during the stress period, but applying the method set out in this Section (end of stress period market value, volatilities, and correlations from the 3-year stress period).
==========================================================
The competent authorities shall require an institution to adjust the stress calibration if the exposures of those benchmark portfolios deviate substantially from each other.
==========================================================
6. An institution shall subject the model to a validation process that is clearly articulated in the institutions' policies and procedures. That validation process shall specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which the assumptions underlying the model are inappropriate and may therefore result in an understatement of EPE. That validation process shall include a review of the comprehensiveness of the model.

In complying with this paragraph, the institution shall for exposures with a rising risk profile after one year, compare on a regular basis the estimate of a relevant measure of exposure over one year with the same exposure measure over the life of the exposure. In complying with this paragraph, the institution shall for exposures with a residual maturity below one year, compare on a regular basis the replacement cost (current exposure) and the realised exposure profile, and store data that would allow such a comparison.

==========================================================
Article 294 : Validation requirements
==========================================================
1. As part of the initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and its risk measures, an institution shall ensure that the following requirements are met .
==========================================================
the institution shall carry out back-testing using historical data on movements in market risk factors prior to the permission by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1). That back-testing shall consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various initialisation dates and covering a wide range of market conditions.
==========================================================
the institution using the approach set out in Article 285(1)(b) shall regularly validate its model to test whether realised current exposures are consistent with prediction over all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk factor sensitivities without these trades, the validation shall take this into account.
==========================================================
it shall back-test the performance of its CCR exposure model and the model's relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons considered shall include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collateralised or margined trading.
==========================================================
if the model validation indicates that effective EPE is underestimated, the institution shall take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model.
==========================================================
it shall test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors as part of the initial and on-going model validation process. Pricing models for options shall account for the nonlinearity of option value with respect to market risk factors.
==========================================================
the CCR exposure model shall capture the transaction-specific information necessary to be able to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. An institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.
==========================================================
the CCR exposure model shall include transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining. It shall take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model shall account for the nature of margin agreements that are unilateral or bilateral, the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the minimum threshold of un-margined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model shall either estimate the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or apply the rules set out in Chapter 4.
==========================================================
the model validation process shall include static, historical back-testing on representative counterparty portfolios. An institution shall conduct such back-testing on a number of representative counterparty portfolios that are actual or hypothetical at regular intervals. Those representative portfolios shall be chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to the material risk factors and combinations of risk factors to which the institution is exposed.
==========================================================
SUBJ: the model validation process
VERB: include
DATA: static , historical back - testing on representative counterparty portfolios

==========================================================
an institution shall conduct back-testing that is designed to test the key assumptions of the CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures, including the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors.
==========================================================
the performance of CCR exposure models and its risk measures shall be subject to appropriate back-testing practice. The back testing programme shall be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model's risk measures.
==========================================================
an institution shall validate its CCR exposure models and all risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using IMM in accordance to the Article 283.
==========================================================
an institution shall regularly test the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the on-going model validation process.
==========================================================
the on-going validation of an institution's CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures shall include an assessment of the adequacy of the recent performance.

2. A measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate regulatory exposure value for every counterparty may be used in place of alpha multiplied by Effective EPE with the prior permission of the competent authorities. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial approval by the competent authorities and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models. An institution shall validate the conservatism regularly. The on-going assessment of model performance shall cover all counterparties for which the models are used.

Netting across transactions entered into by different legal entities of a group shall not be recognised for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements.
==========================================================
Article 296 : Recognition of contractual netting agreements
==========================================================
1. Competent authorities shall recognise a contractual netting agreement only where the conditions in paragraph 2 and, where relevant, 3 are fulfilled.
==========================================================
2. The following conditions shall be fulfilled by all contractual netting agreements used by an institution for the purposes of determining exposure value in this Part 
==========================================================
the institution has concluded a contractual netting agreement with its counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that, in the event of default by the counterparty it would be entitled to receive or obliged to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions
==========================================================
the institution has made available to the competent authorities written and reasoned legal opinions to the effect that, in the event of a legal challenge of the netting agreement, the institution's claims and obligations would not exceed those referred to in point (a). The legal opinion shall refer to the applicable law ❬the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated and/or if a branch of an undertaking is involved, which is located in a country other than that where the undertaking is incorporated, the jurisdiction in which the branch is located and/or the jurisdiction whose law governs the individual transactions included in the netting agreement and/or the jurisdiction whose law governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting❭
==========================================================
credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counterparty. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes
==========================================================
the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk away clause)
==========================================================
If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties. Competent authorities shall inform each other accordingly.
==========================================================
SUBJ: competent authorities
VERB: inform
DEST: each other
FREQ: very likely reoccurring

3. The legal opinions referred to in point (b) may be drawn up by reference to types of contractual netting. The following additional conditions shall be fulfilled by contractual cross-product netting agreements 
==========================================================
the net sum referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 is the net sum of the positive and negative close out values of any included individual bilateral master agreement and of the positive and negative mark-to-market value of the individual transactions (the "Cross-Product Net Amount")
==========================================================
the legal opinions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 shall address the validity and enforceability of the entire contractual cross-product netting agreement under its terms and the impact of the netting arrangement on the material provisions of any included individual bilateral master agreement
==========================================================
Article 297 : Obligations of institutions
==========================================================
1. An institution shall establish and maintain procedures to ensure that the legal validity and enforceability of its contractual netting is reviewed in the light of changes in the law of relevant jurisdictions referred to in Article 296(2)(b).

3. The institution shall factor the effects of netting into its measurement of each counterparty's aggregate credit risk exposure and the institution shall manage its CCR on the basis of those effects of that measurement.
==========================================================
4. In the case of contractual cross-product netting agreements referred to in Article 295, the institution shall maintain procedures under Article 296(2)(c) to verify that any transaction which is to be included in a netting set is covered by a legal opinion referred to in Article 296(2)(b).

==========================================================
Taking into account the contractual cross-product netting agreement, the institution shall continue to comply with the requirements for the recognition of bilateral netting and the requirements of Chapter 4 for the recognition of credit risk mitigation, as applicable, with respect to each included individual bilateral master agreement and transaction.
==========================================================
Article 298 : Effects of recognition of netting as risk-reducing
==========================================================
1. The following treatment applies to contractual netting agreements 
==========================================================
netting for the purposes of Sections 5 and 6 shall be recognised as set out in those Sections
==========================================================
in the case of contracts for novation, the single net amounts fixed by such contracts rather than the gross amounts involved, may be weighted
==========================================================
In the application of Section 3, institutions may take the contract for novation into account when determining the current replacement cost referred to in Article 274(1).
==========================================================
In the application of Section 3, institutions may take the contract for novation into account when determining the notional principal amounts or underlying values referred to in Article 274(2).
==========================================================
In the application of Section 4, in determining the notional amount referred to in Article 275(1) institutions may take into account the contract for novation for the purposes of calculating the notional principal amount In such cases, institutions shall apply the percentages of Table 3.
==========================================================
(c) In the case of other netting agreements, institutions shall apply Section 3 as described in the following list 
==========================================================
the current replacement cost referred to in Article 274(1) for the contracts included in a netting agreement shall be obtained by taking account of the actual hypothetical net replacement cost which results from the agreement; in the case where netting leads to a net obligation for the institution calculating the net replacement cost, the current replacement cost is calculated as "0"
==========================================================
the figure for potential future credit exposure referred to in Article 274(2) for all contracts included in a netting agreement shall be reduced in accordance with the following formula ❬where ⟨⟩ and/or PCEred = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts with a given counterparty included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement and/or PCEgross = the sum of the figures for potential future credit exposure for all contracts with a given counterparty which are included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement and are calculated by multiplying their notional principal amounts by the percentages set out in Table 1 and/or NGR = the net-to-gross ratio calculated as the quotient of the net replacement cost for all contracts included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement with a given counterparty (numerator) and the gross replacement cost for all contracts included in a legally valid bilateral netting agreement with that counterparty (denominator)❭
==========================================================
2. When carrying out the calculation of the potential future credit exposure in accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 1, institutions may treat perfectly matching contracts included in the netting agreement as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equivalent to the net receipts.
==========================================================
In the application of Article 275(1) institutions may treat perfectly matching contracts included in the netting agreement as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equivalent to the net receipts, and the notional principal amounts shall be multiplied by the percentages given in Table 3.
==========================================================
For the purposes of this paragraph, perfectly matching contracts are forward foreign-exchange contracts or similar contracts in which a notional principal is equivalent to cash flows if the cash flows fall due on the same value date and fully in the same currency.
==========================================================
3. For all other contracts included in a netting agreement, the percentages applicable may be reduced as indicated in Table 6:
==========================================================
Table 6
==========================================================
Original maturity Interest-rate contracts Foreign-exchange contracts
==========================================================
One year or less 0,35 % 1,50 %

==========================================================
2. When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty risk of items in the trading book, institutions shall comply with the following principles 
==========================================================
in the case of total return swap credit derivatives and credit default swap credit derivatives, to obtain a figure for potential future credit exposure under the method set out in Section 3, the nominal amount of the instrument shall be multiplied by the following percentages ❬5 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or 10 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would not be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or In the case of an institution whose exposure arising from a credit default swap represents a long position in the underlying, the percentage for potential future credit exposure may be 0 %, unless the credit default swap is subject to close-out upon the insolvency of the entity whose exposure arising from the swap represents a short position in the underlying, even though the underlying has not defaulted and/or Where the credit derivative provides protection in relation to "nth to default" amongst a number of underlying obligations, an institution shall determine which of the percentage figures set out in the first subparagraph applies by reference to the obligation with the nth lowest credit quality which, if incurred by the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2❭
==========================================================
institutions shall not use the Financial Collateral Simple Method set out in Article 222 for the recognition of the effects of financial collateral
==========================================================
in the case of repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise as eligible collateral all financial instruments and commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book
==========================================================
for exposures arising from OTC derivative instruments booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book as eligible collateral
==========================================================
for the purposes of calculating volatility adjustments where such financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4 are lent, sold or provided, or borrowed, purchased or received by way of collateral or otherwise under such a transaction, and an institution is using the Supervisory volatility adjustments approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4, institutions shall treat such instruments and commodities in the same way as non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange
==========================================================
where an institution is using the Own Estimates of Volatility adjustments approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4 in respect of financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4, it shall calculate volatility adjustments for each individual item. Where an institution has obtained the approval to use the Internal Models Approach defined in Chapter 4, it may also apply that approach in the trading book
==========================================================
in relation to the recognition of master netting agreements covering repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, or other capital market-driven transactions, institutions shall only recognise netting across positions in the trading book and the non-trading book when the netted transactions fulfil the following conditions ❬all transactions are marked to market daily and/or any items borrowed, purchased or received under the transactions may be recognised as eligible financial collateral under Chapter 4 without the application of points (c) to (f) of this paragraph❭
==========================================================
where a credit derivative included in the trading book forms part of an internal hedge and the credit protection is recognised under this Regulation in accordance with Article 204, institutions shall apply one of the following approaches ❬❭
==========================================================
treat it as if there were no counterparty risk arising from the position in that credit derivative
==========================================================
(ii) consistently include for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk all credit derivatives in the trading book forming part of internal hedges or purchased as protection against a CCR exposure where the credit protection is recognised as eligible under Chapter 4.

==========================================================
2. Where an institution acting as a clearing member enters into a contractual arrangement with a client of another clearing member that facilitates, in accordance with Article 48(5) and (6), of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the transfer of positions and collateral referred to in Article 305(2)(b) of this Regulation for that client, and that contractual agreement gives rise to a contingent obligation for that institution, that institution may attribute an exposure value of zero to that contingent obligation.
==========================================================
3. An institution acting as a clearing member may apply a shorter margin period of risk when calculating the own fund requirement for its exposures to a client in accordance with the Internal Model Method. The margin period of risk applied by the institution shall not be less than five days.
==========================================================
4. An institution acting as a clearing member may multiply its EAD by a scalar when calculating the own fund requirement for its exposures to a client in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method, the Standardised Method or the Original Exposure Method.

==========================================================
Article 305 : Treatment of clients' exposures
==========================================================
1. Where an institution is a client, it shall calculate the own funds requirements for its CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter and with Title VI of Part Three, as applicable.
==========================================================
2. Without prejudice to the approach specified in paragraph 1, where an institution is a client, it may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306 provided that all the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
the positions and assets of that institution related to those transactions are distinguished and segregated, at the level of both the clearing member and the CCP, from the positions and assets of both the clearing member and the other clients of that clearing member and as a result of that distinction and segregation those positions and assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of the clearing member or one or more of its other clients
==========================================================
laws, regulations, rules and contractual arrangements applicable to or binding that institution or the CCP facilitate the transfer of the client's positions relating to those contracts and transactions and of the corresponding collateral to another clearing member within the applicable margin period of risk in the event of default or insolvency of the original clearing member. In such circumstance, the client's positions and the collateral shall be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value
==========================================================
the institution has available an independent, written and reasoned legal opinion that concludes that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that the client would bear no losses on account of the insolvency of its clearing member or of any of its clearing member's clients under the laws of the jurisdiction of the institution, its clearing member and the CCP, the law governing the transactions and contracts the institution clears through the CCP, the law governing the collateral, and the law governing any contract or agreement necessary to meet the condition in point (b)
==========================================================
the CCP is a QCCP
==========================================================
3. Without prejudice to the conditions specified in paragraph 2, where an institution that is a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and another client of the clearing member jointly default, but all the other conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met, the client may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306, subject to replacing the 2 % risk weight in paragraph 1(a) of that Article with a 4 % risk weight.
==========================================================
4. Where an institution that is a client accesses the services of a CCP through indirect clearing arrangements, in accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, that institution may apply the treatment set out in paragraph 2 or 3 only where the conditions in each paragraph are met at every level of the chain of intermediaries.
==========================================================
Article 306 : Own funds requirements for trade exposures
==========================================================
1. An institution shall apply the following treatment to its trade exposures with CCPs 
==========================================================
it shall apply a risk weight of 2 % to the exposure values of all its trade exposures with QCCPs
==========================================================
it shall apply the risk weight used for the Standardised Approach to credit risk as set out in Article 107(2)(b) to all its trade exposures with non-qualifying CCPs
==========================================================
where an institution is acting as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP and the terms of the CCP-related transaction stipulate that the institution is not obligated to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of that transaction in the event that the CCP defaults, the exposure value of the transaction with the CCP that corresponds to that CCP-related transaction is equal to zero
==========================================================
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where assets posted as collateral to a CCP or a clearing member are bankruptcy remote in the event that the CCP, the clearing member or one or more of the other clients of the clearing member becomes insolvent, an institution may attribute an exposure value of zero to the counterparty credit risk exposures for those assets.
==========================================================
3. An institution shall calculate exposure values of its trade exposures with a CCP in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter, as applicable.
==========================================================
4. An institution shall calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts for its trade exposures with CCPs for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the sum of the exposure values of its trade exposures with CCPs, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, multiplied by the risk weight determined in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.

Article 308 : Own funds requirements for pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a QCCP
==========================================================
1. The exposure value for an institution's pre-funded contribution to the default fund of a QCCP (DFi) shall be the amount paid in or the market value of the assets delivered by that institution reduced by any amount of that contribution that the QCCP has already used to absorb its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members.
==========================================================
2. An institution shall calculate the own funds requirement (Ki) to cover the exposure arising from its pre-funded contribution (DFi) as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
β = the concentration factor communicated to the institution by the CCP;
==========================================================
N = the number of clearing members communicated to the institution by the CCP;
==========================================================
DFCM = the sum of pre-funded contributions of all clearing members of the CCP communicated to the institution by the CCP;
==========================================================
KCM = the sum of the own funds requirements of all clearing members of the CCP calculated in accordance with the applicable formula specified in paragraph 3 .
==========================================================
3. An institution shall calculate KCM as described in the following list 
==========================================================
where KCCP ≤ DFCCP, the institution shall use the following formula ❬❭
==========================================================
where DFCCP < KCCP ≤DF*, the institution shall use the following formula ❬❭
==========================================================
where DF* < KCCP, the institution shall use the following formula ❬where ⟨⟩ and/or DFCCP = the pre-funded financial resources of the CCP communicated to the institution by the CCP and/or KCCP = the hypothetical capital of the CCP communicated to the institution by the CCP and/or DF* = ; = = the average pre-funded contribution, , communicated to the institution by the CCP and/or c1 = a capital factor equal to and/or c2 = a capital factor equal to 100 % and/or μ = 1,2❭

4. An institution shall calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts for exposures arising from an institution's pre-funded contribution for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the own funds requirement (Ki) determined in accordance with paragraph 2 multiplied by 12,5.
==========================================================
5. Where KCCP is equal to zero, institutions shall use the value for c1 of 0,16 % for the purpose of the calculation in paragraph 3.
==========================================================
Article 309 : Own funds requirements for pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP and for unfunded contributions to a non-qualifying CCP
==========================================================
1. An institution shall apply the following formula to calculate the own funds requirement (Ki) for the exposures arising from its pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP (DFi) and from unfunded contributions (UCi) to such CCP:
==========================================================
where c2·and μ are defined as in Article 308(3).
==========================================================
2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, unfunded contributions means contributions that an institution acting as a clearing member has contractually committed to provide to a CCP after the CCP has depleted its default fund to cover the losses it incurred following the default of one or more of its clearing members.
==========================================================
3. An institution shall calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts for exposures arising from an institution's pre-funded contribution for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the own funds requirement (Ki) determined in accordance with paragraph 1 multiplied by 12,5.

==========================================================
2. Where only the condition in point (a) of paragraph 1 has been met, the competent authority of the institution shall verify the reasons why the CCP has stopped calculating KCCP.
==========================================================
Where the competent authority considers that the reasons referred to in the first subparagraph are valid, it may permit institutions in its Member State to apply the treatment set out in Article 310 to their trade exposures and default fund contributions to that CCP. Where it grants such permission, it shall disclose the reasons for its decision.

CHAPTER 2 : Basic indicator approach
==========================================================
Article 315 : Own funds requirement
==========================================================
1. Under the Basic Indicator Approach, the own funds requirement for operational risk is equal to 15 % of the average over three years of the relevant indicator as set out in Article 316.
==========================================================
Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the relevant indicator on the basis of the last three twelve-monthly observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates.
==========================================================
2. Where an institution has been in operation for less than three years it may use forward-looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as it is available.
==========================================================
3. Where an institution can prove to its competent authority that, due to a merger, an acquisition or a disposal of entities or activities, using a three year average to calculate the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit the institution to amend the calculation in a way that would take into account such events and shall duly inform EBA thereof. In such circumstances, the competent authority may, on its own initiative, also require an institution to amend the calculation.
==========================================================

4. Where for any given observation, the relevant indicator is negative or equal to zero, institutions shall not take into account this figure in the calculation of the average over three years. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years as the sum of positive figures divided by the number of positive figures.
==========================================================
Article 316 : Relevant indicator
==========================================================
1. For institutions applying accounting standards established by Directive 86/635/EEC, based on the accounting categories for the profit and loss account of institutions under Article 27 of that Directive, the relevant indicator is the sum of the elements listed in Table 1 of this paragraph. Institutions shall include each element in the sum with its positive or negative sign.
==========================================================
Table 1 1 Interest receivable and similar income 2 Interest payable and similar charges 3 Income from shares and other variable/fixed-yield securities 4 Commissions/fees receivable 5 Commissions/fees payable 6 Net profit or net loss on financial operations 7 Other operating income
==========================================================
Institutions shall adjust these elements to reflect the following qualifications 
==========================================================
institutions shall calculate the relevant indicator before the deduction of any provisions and operating expenses. Institutions shall include in operating expenses fees paid for outsourcing services rendered by third parties which are not a parent or subsidiary of the institution or a subsidiary of a parent which is also the parent of the institution. Institutions may use expenditure on the outsourcing of services rendered by third parties to reduce the relevant indicator where the expenditure is incurred from an undertaking subject to rules under, or equivalent to, this Regulation
==========================================================
institutions shall not use the following elements in the calculation of the relevant indicator ❬realised profits/losses from the sale of non-trading book items and/or income from extraordinary or irregular items and/or income derived from insurance❭
==========================================================
when revaluation of trading items is part of the profit and loss statement, institutions may include revaluation. When institutions apply Article 36(2) of Directive 86/635/EEC, they shall include revaluation booked in the profit and loss account
==========================================================
2. When institutions apply accounting standards different from those established by Directive 86/635/EEC, they shall calculate the relevant indicator on the basis of data that best reflect the definition set out in this Article.
==========================================================
3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the methodology to calculate the relevant indicator referred to in paragraph 2.

==========================================================
Article 317 : Own funds requirement
==========================================================
1. Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall divide their activities into the business lines set out in Table 2 of paragraph 4 and in accordance with the principles set out in Article 318.
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk as the average over three years of the sum of the annual own funds requirements across all business lines referred to in Table 2 of paragraph 4. The annual own funds requirement of each business line is equal to the product of the corresponding beta factor referred to in that Table and the part of the relevant indicator mapped to the respective business line.
==========================================================
3. In any given year, institutions may offset negative own funds requirements resulting from a negative part of the relevant indicator in any business line with positive own funds requirements in other business lines without limit. However, where the aggregate own funds requirement across all business lines within a given year is negative, institutions shall use the value zero as the input to the numerator for that year.
==========================================================
4. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the sum referred to in paragraph 2 on the basis of the last three twelve-monthly observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates.
==========================================================
Where an institution can prove to its competent authority that, due to a merger, an acquisition or a disposal of entities or activities, using a three year average to calculate the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit institutions to amend the calculation in a way that would take into account such events and shall duly inform EBA thereof.

==========================================================
institutions shall map all activities into the business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner
==========================================================
institutions shall allocate any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary activity to an activity included in the framework, to the business line it supports. Where more than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, institutions shall use an objective-mapping criterion
==========================================================
where an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then institutions shall use the business line yielding the highest percentage. The same business line equally applies to any ancillary activity associated with that activity
==========================================================
institutions may use internal pricing methods to allocate the relevant indicator between business lines. Costs generated in one business line which are imputable to a different business line may be reallocated to the business line to which they pertain
==========================================================
the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes shall be consistent with the categories institutions use for credit and market risks

==========================================================
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
==========================================================
Article 319 : Alternative Standardised Approach
==========================================================
1. Under the Alternative Standardised Approach, for the business lines "retail banking" and "commercial banking", institutions shall apply the following 
==========================================================
the relevant indicator is a normalised income indicator equal to the nominal amount of loans and advances multiplied by 0,035
==========================================================
the loans and advances consist of the total drawn amounts in the corresponding credit portfolios. For the "commercial banking" business line, institutions shall also include securities held in the non trading book in the nominal amount of loans and advances
==========================================================
2. To be permitted to use the Alternative Standardised Approach, an institution shall meet all the following conditions 
==========================================================
its retail or commercial banking activities shall account for at least 90 % of its income
==========================================================
a significant proportion of its retail or commercial banking activities shall comprise loans associated with a high PD
==========================================================
the Alternative Standardised Approach provides an appropriate basis for calculating its own funds requirement for operational risk

==========================================================
data flows and processes associated with an institution's risk measurement system shall be transparent and accessible
==========================================================
Article 322 : Quantitative Standards
==========================================================
1. The quantitative standards referred to in Article 312(2) include the standards relating to process, to internal data, to external data, to scenario analysis, to business environment and to internal control factors laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 respectively.
==========================================================
2. The standards relating to process are the following .
==========================================================
an institution shall calculate its own funds requirement as comprising both expected loss and unexpected loss, unless expected loss is adequately captured in its internal business practices. The operational risk measure shall capture potentially severe tail events, achieving a soundness standard comparable to a 99,9 % confidence interval over a one year period.
==========================================================
an institution's operational risk measurement system shall include the use of internal data, external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business environment and internal control systems as set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. An institution shall have in place a well documented approach for weighting the use of these four elements in its overall operational risk measurement system.

==========================================================
SUBJ: an institution 's risk measurement system
VERB: capture
DATA: the major drivers of risk affecting the shape of the tail of the estimated distribution of losses
FREQ: likely reoccurring
FREQ: maybe happening once
==========================================================
an institution may recognise correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk estimates only where its systems for measuring correlations are sound, implemented with integrity, and take into account the uncertainty surrounding any such correlation estimates, particularly in periods of stress. An institution shall validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques.
==========================================================
an institution's risk measurement system shall be internally consistent and shall avoid the multiple counting of qualitative assessments or risk mitigation techniques recognised in other areas of this Regulation.
==========================================================
3. The standards relating to internal data are the following .
==========================================================
an institution shall base its internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a three-year historical observation period.
==========================================================
an institution shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 317 and into the event types defined in Article 324, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In exceptional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line "corporate items". An institution shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. An institution shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that the institution has historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, provided that the institution is required to continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. An institution shall include operational risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk.

==========================================================
an institution's internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations. An institution shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. An institution shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection.
==========================================================
aside from information on gross loss amounts, an institution shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event.
==========================================================
SUBJ: an institution

==========================================================
4. The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following .
==========================================================
an institution's operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system.
==========================================================
SUBJ: an institution

==========================================================
5. An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness.
==========================================================
6. The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following .
==========================================================
an institution's firm-wide risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile.
==========================================================
SUBJ: an institution 's firm - wide risk assessment methodology

==========================================================
an institution shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas.
==========================================================
an institution shall be able to justify to competent authorities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution's risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume.
==========================================================
an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, an institution shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.

The insurance provider shall be authorised to provide insurance or re-insurance and shall have a minimum claims paying ability rating by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions under Title II, Chapter 2.
==========================================================
SUBJ: the insurance provider
VERB: provide
DATA: insurance or re - insurance
FREQ: likely reoccurring

==========================================================
3. The insurance and the institutions' insurance framework shall meet all the following conditions 
==========================================================
the insurance policy has an initial term of no less than one year. For policies with a residual term of less than one year, an institution shall make appropriate haircuts reflecting the declining residual term of the policy, up to a full 100 % haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less
==========================================================
the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of the contract of 90 days
==========================================================
the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by supervisory actions or, in the case of a failed institution, that preclude the institution's receiver or liquidator from recovering the damages suffered or expenses incurred by the institution, except in respect of events occurring after the initiation of receivership or liquidation proceedings in respect of the institution. However, the insurance policy may exclude any fine, penalty, or punitive damages resulting from actions by the competent authorities
==========================================================
the risk mitigation calculations shall reflect the insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the overall determination of operational risk capital
==========================================================
the insurance is provided by a third party entity. In the case of insurance through captives and affiliates, the exposure has to be laid off to an independent third party entity that meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraph 2
==========================================================
the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented
==========================================================
4. The methodology for recognising insurance shall capture all the following elements through discounts or haircuts in the amount of insurance recognition 
==========================================================
5. The reduction in own funds requirements from the recognition of insurances and other risk transfer mechanisms shall not exceed 20 % of the own funds requirement for operational risk before the recognition of risk mitigation techniques.
==========================================================
Article 324 : Loss event type classification
==========================================================
The loss events types referred to in point (b) of Article 322(3) are the following:
==========================================================
Table 3
==========================================================
Event-Type Category Definition

==========================================================
TITLE IV : OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK
==========================================================
CHAPTER 1 : General Provisions
==========================================================
Article 325 : Allowances for consolidated requirements
==========================================================
1. Subject to paragraph 2 and only for the purpose of calculating net positions and own funds requirements in accordance with this Title on a consolidated basis, institutions may use positions in one institution or undertaking to offset positions in another institution or undertaking.
==========================================================
2. Institutions may apply paragraph 1 only subject to the permission of the competent authorities, which shall be granted if all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
3. Where there are undertakings located in third countries all of the following conditions shall be met in addition to those in paragraph 2 
==========================================================
CHAPTER 2 : Own funds requirements for position risk
==========================================================
Section 1 : General provisions and specific instruments
==========================================================
Article 326 : Own funds requirements for position risk
==========================================================
The institution's own funds requirement for position risk shall be the sum of the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of its positions in debt and equity instruments. Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments.
==========================================================
Article 327 : Netting
==========================================================
1. The absolute value of the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calculating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 328 to 330. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 336.
==========================================================
2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the likelihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines.

==========================================================
3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, shall be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggregation.
==========================================================
Article 328 : Interest rate futures and forwards
==========================================================
1. Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.
==========================================================
2. For the purposes of this Article, "long position" means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and "short position" means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future.
==========================================================
Article 329 : Options and warrants
==========================================================
1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks, apart from the delta risk, associated with options in the own funds requirements.
==========================================================
3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, referred to in paragraph 2 in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options and warrants.
==========================================================
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.
==========================================================

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
==========================================================
4. Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in paragraph 3, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.
==========================================================
Article 330 : Swaps
==========================================================
Swaps shall be treated for interest-rate risk purposes on the same basis as on-balance-sheet instruments. Thus, an interest-rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself.
==========================================================
Article 331 : Interest rate risk on derivative instruments
==========================================================
1. Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.

==========================================================
Article 332 : Credit Derivatives
==========================================================
1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the "protection seller"), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as described in the following list 
==========================================================
a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation
==========================================================
a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds

::::: ARGM-ADV: unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item , in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded
==========================================================
a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded
==========================================================
VERB: recorded
DATA: a single long position with the specific risk of the note
FREQ: very likely reoccurring
::::: ARGM-TMP: when the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item
::::: ARGM-MOD: need
::::: ARGM-ADV: only
==========================================================
in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk
==========================================================
a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk
==========================================================
A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.
==========================================================
Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable.
==========================================================
2. For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the "protection buyer", the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a step-up, such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.
==========================================================
3. Credit derivatives in accordance with Article 338(1) or (3) shall be included only in the determination of the specific risk own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338(4).
==========================================================
Article 333 : Securities sold under a repurchase agreement or lent
==========================================================
The transferor of securities or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities in a repurchase agreement and the lender of securities in a securities lending shall include these securities in the calculation of its own funds requirement under this Chapter provided that such securities are trading book positions.
==========================================================
Section 2 : Debt instruments
==========================================================
Article 334 : Net positions in debt instruments
==========================================================
Net positions shall be classified according to the currency in which they are denominated and shall calculate the own funds requirement for general and specific risk in each individual currency separately.
==========================================================
Sub-Section 1 : Specific risk
==========================================================
Article 335 : Cap on the own funds requirement for a net position
==========================================================
The institution may cap the own funds requirement for specific risk of a net position in a debt instrument at the maximum possible default-risk related loss. For a short position, that limit may be calculated as a change in value due to the instrument or, where relevant, the underlying names immediately becoming default risk-free.
==========================================================
Article 336 : Own funds requirement for non-securitisation debt instruments

The institution shall assign its net positions in the trading book in instruments that are not securitisation positions as calculated in accordance with Article 327 to the appropriate categories in Table 1 on the basis of their issuer or obligor, external or internal credit assessment, and residual maturity, and then multiply them by the weightings shown in that table. It shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of this Article regardless of whether they are long or short in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk.

Article 337 : Own funds requirement for securitisation instruments
==========================================================
1. For instruments in the trading book that are securitisation positions, the institution shall weight with the following its net positions as calculated in accordance with Article 327(1) 
==========================================================
2. The Supervisory Formula Method set out in Article 262 may be used where the institution can produce estimates of PD, and where applicable exposure value and LGD as inputs into the Supervisory Formula Method in accordance with the requirements for the estimation of those parameters under the Internal Ratings Based Approach in accordance with Title II, Chapter 3.
==========================================================
An institution other than an originator institution that could apply it for the same securitisation position in its non-trading book may only use that method subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted where the institution fulfils the condition in the first subparagraph.
==========================================================
Estimates of PD and LGD as inputs to the Supervisory Formula Method may alternatively also be determined based on estimates that are derived from an IRC approach of an institution that has been granted permission to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments. The latter alternative may be used only subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted if those estimates meet the quantitative requirements for the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Title II, Chapter 3.
==========================================================
In accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA shall issue guidelines on the use of estimates of PD and LGD as inputs when those estimates are based on an IRC approach.

3. For securitisation positions that are subject to an additional risk weight in accordance with Article 407, 8 % of the total risk weight shall be applied.
==========================================================
Except for securitisation positions treated in accordance with Article 338(4), the institution shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of this Article (regardless of whether they are long or short) in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk.
==========================================================
4. By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, for a transitional period ending 31 December 2014, the institution shall sum separately its weighted net long positions and its weighted net short positions. The larger of those sums shall constitute the specific risk own funds requirement. The institution shall, however, quarterly report to the competent authority of the home Member State the total sum of its weighted net long and net short positions, broken down by types of underlying assets.
==========================================================
5. Where an originator institution of a traditional securitisation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer in Article 243, it shall include in the calculation of the own funds requirement under this Article the securitised exposures instead of its securitisation positions from this securitisation.
==========================================================
Where an originator institution of a synthetic securitisation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer in Article 244, it shall include in the calculation of the own funds requirement under this Article the securitised exposures from this securitisation, but not any credit protection obtained for the securitised portfolio.
==========================================================
Article 338 : Own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio
==========================================================
1. The correlation trading portfolio shall consist of securitisation positions and n-th-to-default credit derivatives that meet all of the following criteria 
==========================================================
2. Positions which reference any of the following shall not be part of the correlation trading portfolio 
==========================================================
3. An institution may include in the correlation trading portfolio positions which are neither securitisation positions nor n-th-to-default credit derivatives but which hedge other positions of that portfolio, provided that a liquid two-way market as described in the last subparagraph of paragraph 1 exists for the instrument or its underlyings.
==========================================================
4. An institution shall determine the larger of the following amounts as the specific risk own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio 
==========================================================
Sub-Section 2 : General risk
==========================================================
Article 339 : Maturity-based calculation of general risk
==========================================================
1. In order to calculate own funds requirements against general risk all positions shall be weighted according to maturity as explained in paragraph 2 in order to compute the amount of own funds required against them. This requirement shall be reduced when a weighted position is held alongside an opposite weighted position within the same maturity band. A reduction in the requirement shall also be made when the opposite weighted positions fall into different maturity bands, with the size of this reduction depending both on whether the two positions fall into the same zone, or not, and on the particular zones they fall into.
==========================================================
2. The institution shall assign its net positions to the appropriate maturity bands in column 2 or 3, as appropriate, in Table 2 in paragraph 4. It shall do so on the basis of residual maturity in the case of fixed-rate instruments and on the basis of the period until the interest rate is next set in the case of instruments on which the interest rate is variable before final maturity. It shall also distinguish between debt instruments with a coupon of 3 % or more and those with a coupon of less than 3 % and thus allocate them to column 2 or column 3 in Table 2. It shall then multiply each of them by the weighing for the maturity band in question in column 4 in Table 2.
==========================================================
3. The institution shall then work out the sum of the weighted long positions and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band. The total of the matched weighted positions in all bands shall then be calculated.
==========================================================
4. The institution shall compute the totals of the unmatched weighted long positions for the bands included in each of the zones in Table 2 in order to derive the unmatched weighted long position for each zone. Similarly, the sum of the unmatched weighted short positions for each band in a particular zone shall be summed to compute the unmatched weighted short position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long position for a given zone that is matched by the unmatched weighted short position for the same zone shall be the matched weighted position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long or unmatched weighted short position for a zone that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched weighted position for that zone.

5. The amount of the unmatched weighted long or short position in zone one which is matched by the unmatched weighted short or long position in zone two shall then be the matched weighted position between zones one and two. The same calculation shall then be undertaken with regard to that part of the unmatched weighted position in zone two which is left over and the unmatched weighted position in zone three in order to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three.
==========================================================
6. The institution may reverse the order in paragraph 5 so as to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three before calculating that position between zones one and two.
==========================================================
7. The remainder of the unmatched weighted position in zone one shall then be matched with what remains of that for zone three after the latter's matching with zone two in order to derive the matched weighted position between zones one and three.
==========================================================
8. Residual positions, following the three separate matching calculations in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 shall be summed.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 10 % of the sum of the matched weighted positions in all maturity bands.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 40 % of the matched weighted position in zone one.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 30 % of the matched weighted position in zone two.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 30 % of the matched weighted position in zone three.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 40 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and two and between zones two and three.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 150 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and three.
==========================================================
9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of 100 % of the residual unmatched weighted positions.
==========================================================
Article 340 : Duration-based calculation of general risk
==========================================================
1. Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 339, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis.
==========================================================
2. Under the duration-based approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each fixed-rate debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of floating-rate instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed.
==========================================================
3. The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
D = duration calculated according to the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
R = yield to maturity;
==========================================================
Ct = cash payment in time t;
==========================================================
M = total maturity.
==========================================================
Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections.

==========================================================

==========================================================
5. The institution shall then calculate the duration-weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest-rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).
==========================================================
6. The institution shall calculate its duration-weighted long and its duration-weighted short positions within each zone. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched duration-weighted position for that zone.
==========================================================
The institution shall then calculate the unmatched duration-weighted positions for each zone. It shall then follow the procedures laid down for unmatched weighted positions in Article 339(5) to (8).
==========================================================
7. The institution's own funds requirement shall then be calculated as the sum of the following 
==========================================================
Section 3 : Equities
==========================================================
Article 341 : Net positions in equity instruments
==========================================================
1. The institution shall separately sum all its net long positions and all its net short positions in accordance with Article 327. The sum of the absolute values of the two figures shall be its overall gross position.
==========================================================
2. The institution shall calculate, separately for each market, the difference between the sum of the net long and the net short positions. The sum of the absolute values of those differences shall be its overall net position.

==========================================================
3. Full allowance shall be given when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same extent. This will be the case in the following situations 
==========================================================
In these situations, a specific risk own funds requirement shall not be applied to either side of the position.
==========================================================
4. An 80 % offset will be applied when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure. In addition, key features of the credit derivative contract shall not cause the price movement of the credit derivative to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80 % specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction with the higher own funds requirement, while the specific risk requirements on the other side shall be zero.
==========================================================
5. Partial allowance shall be given, absent the situations in paragraphs 3 and 4, in the following situations 
==========================================================
the position falls under paragraph 3(b) but there is an asset mismatch between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure. However, the positions meet the following requirements ❬the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation and/or the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same obligor and have legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses❭
==========================================================
the position falls under paragraph 3(a) or paragraph 4 but there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying asset. Such currency mismatch shall be included in the own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk
==========================================================
the position falls under paragraph 4 but there is an asset mismatch between the cash position and the credit derivative. However, the underlying asset is included in the (deliverable) obligations in the credit derivative documentation
==========================================================
In order to give partial allowance, rather than adding the specific risk own funds requirements for each side of the transaction, only the higher of the two own funds requirements shall apply.
==========================================================
6. In all situations not falling under paragraphs 3 to 5, an own funds requirement for specific risk shall be calculated for both sides of the positions separately.
==========================================================
Article 347 : Allowance for hedges by first and nth-to default credit derivatives
==========================================================
In the case of first-to-default credit derivatives and nth-to-default credit derivatives, the following treatment applies for the allowance to be given in accordance with Article 346 
==========================================================
where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of reference entities underlying a credit derivative under the terms that the first default among the assets shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may offset specific risk for the reference entity to which the lowest specific risk percentage charge among the underlying reference entities applies according to Table 1 in Article 336
==========================================================
where the nth default among the exposures triggers payment under the credit protection, the protection buyer may only offset specific risk if protection has also been obtained for defaults 1 to n-1 or when n-1 defaults have already occurred. In such cases, the methodology set out in point (a) for first-to-default credit derivatives shall be followed appropriately amended for nth-to-default products

Article 350 : Specific methods for CIUs
==========================================================
1. Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk. Under such an approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, provided that the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.
==========================================================
2. Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in point (a), subject to the following conditions 
==========================================================
3. Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions 
==========================================================
it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position
==========================================================
institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate
==========================================================
if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level
==========================================================
4. Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter

CHAPTER 3 : Own funds requirements for foreign-exchange risk
==========================================================
Article 351 : De minimis and weighting for foreign exchange risk
==========================================================
If the sum of an institution's overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 352, including for any foreign exchange and gold positions for which own funds requirements are calculated using an internal model, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, the institution shall calculate an own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %.
==========================================================
Article 352 : Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position
==========================================================
1. The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative) 
==========================================================
The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.
==========================================================
The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently.
==========================================================
The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force.
==========================================================
2. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.
==========================================================
3. An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently.
==========================================================
4. Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institution's overall net foreign-exchange position.
==========================================================
5. Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.
==========================================================
6. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options.
==========================================================
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.

Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.
==========================================================
Article 353 : Foreign exchange risk of CIUs
==========================================================
1. For the purposes of Article 352, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account.
==========================================================
2. Institutions may rely on the following third parties' reporting of the foreign exchange positions in the CIU 
==========================================================
The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.
==========================================================
3. Where an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions in a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU is invested up to the maximum extent allowed under the CIU's mandate in foreign exchange and institutions shall, for trading book positions, take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the addition of the total long position to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position to the total short open foreign exchange position where the direction of the CIU's investment is available. There shall be no netting allowed between such positions prior to the calculation.
==========================================================
Article 354 : Closely correlated currencies
==========================================================
1. Institutions may provide lower own funds requirements against positions in relevant closely correlated currencies. A pair of currencies is deemed to be closely correlated only if the likelihood of a loss — calculated on the basis of daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years — occurring on equal and opposite positions in such currencies over the following 10 working days, which is 4 % or less of the value of the matched position in question (valued in terms of the reporting currency) has a probability of at least 99 %, when an observation period of three years is used, and 95 %, when an observation period of five years is used. The own-funds requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position.
==========================================================
2. In calculating the requirements of this Chapter, institutions may disregard positions in currencies, which are subject to a legally binding intergovernmental agreement to limit its variation relative to other currencies covered by the same agreement. Institutions shall calculate their matched positions in such currencies and subject them to an own funds requirement no lower than half of the maximum permissible variation laid down in the intergovernmental agreement in question in respect of the currencies concerned.
==========================================================
3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies for which the treatment set out in paragraph 1 is available.

4. The own funds requirement on the matched positions in currencies of Member States participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union may be calculated as 1,6 % of the value of such matched positions.
==========================================================
5. Only the unmatched positions in currencies referred to in this Article shall be incorporated into the overall net open position in accordance with Article 352(4).
==========================================================
6. Where daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years - occurring on equal and opposite positions in a pair of currencies over the following 10 working days show that these two currencies are perfectly positively correlated and the institution always can face a zero bid/ask spread on the respective trades, the institution can, upon explicit permission by its competent authority, apply an own funds requirement of 0 % until the end of 2017.

The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.
==========================================================
3. Options and warrants on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.

1. Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk, commodities risk and any internal model for correlation trading shall meet all of the following requirements .
==========================================================
the model shall capture accurately all material price risks.
==========================================================
the model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, depending on the level of activity of the institution in the respective markets. Where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk-measurement model, the institution shall be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority. The risk- measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held.
==========================================================
2. Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements .
==========================================================
the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves.
==========================================================
the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3).
==========================================================
the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions.
==========================================================
the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions.
==========================================================
the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.

==========================================================
1. Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate. As techniques and best practices for internal validation evolve, institutions shall apply these advances. Internal model validation shall not be limited to back-testing, but shall, at a minimum, also include the following

Section 3 : Requirements particular to specific risk modelling
==========================================================
Article 370 : Requirements for modelling specific risk
==========================================================
An internal model used for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk and an internal model for correlation trading shall meet the following additional requirements 
==========================================================
it explains the historical price variation in the portfolio
==========================================================
it captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio
==========================================================
it is robust to an adverse environment
==========================================================
it is validated through back-testing aimed at assessing whether specific risk is being accurately captured. If the institution performs such back-testing on the basis of relevant sub-portfolios, these shall be chosen in a consistent manner
==========================================================
it captures name-related basis risk and shall in particular be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical positions
==========================================================
it captures event risk
==========================================================
Article 371 : Exclusions from specific risk models
==========================================================
1. An institution may choose to exclude from the calculation of its specific risk own funds requirement using an internal model those positions for which it fulfils an own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with Article 332(1)(e) or Article 337 with exception of those positions that are subject to the approach set out in Article 377.

Article 373 : Scope of the internal IRC model
==========================================================
The internal IRC model shall cover all positions subject to an own funds requirement for specific interest rate risk, including those subject to a 0 % specific risk capital charge under Article 336, but shall not cover securitisation positions and n-th-to-default credit derivatives.
==========================================================
The institution may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, choose to consistently include all listed equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equities. The permission shall be granted if such inclusion is consistent with how the institution internally measures and manages risk.
==========================================================
Article 374 : Parameters of the internal IRC model
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.
==========================================================
2. Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.

==========================================================
3. The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected.
==========================================================
4. The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are re-balanced at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption.
==========================================================
5. The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed.
==========================================================
6. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months.
==========================================================
7. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an institution's internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securitisation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions.
==========================================================
Article 375 : Recognition of hedges in the internal IRC model
==========================================================
1. Hedges may be incorporated into an institution's internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks. Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge's maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments. An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.

2. For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions.
==========================================================
2. For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement.
==========================================================
2. For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies shall be reflected in the own funds requirement.
==========================================================
Article 376 : Particular requirements for the internal IRC model
==========================================================
1. The internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options, structured credit derivatives and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. The institution shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with such products.
==========================================================
2. The internal model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.
==========================================================
3. As part of the independent review and validation of their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter, inclusively for purposes of the risk measurement system, an institution shall in particular do all of the following 
==========================================================
validate that its modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors
==========================================================
perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal model, particularly with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Such tests shall not be limited to the range of events experienced historically
==========================================================
apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks
==========================================================
4. The internal model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.

TITLE V : OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTLEMENT RISK
==========================================================
Article 378 : Settlement/delivery risk
==========================================================
In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed.
==========================================================
The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.
==========================================================
The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appropriate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

Capital treatment for free deliveries
==========================================================
Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

==========================================================
Free delivery No capital charge Treat as an exposure Treat as an exposure risk weighted at 1 250 %
==========================================================
2. In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other non-trading book exposure, on the basis of the counterparty's external rating. Institutions using own estimates of "LGDs" may apply the LGD set out in Article 161(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures.
==========================================================
If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.
==========================================================
3. As an alternative to applying a risk weight of 1 250 % to free delivery exposures according to Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1, institutions may deduct the value transferred plus the current positive exposure of those exposures from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).
==========================================================
Article 380 : Waiver
==========================================================
Where a system wide failure of a settlement system, a clearing system or a CCP occurs, competent authorities may waive the own funds requirements calculated as set out in Articles 378 and 379 until the situation is rectified. In this case, the failure of a counterparty to settle a trade shall not be deemed a default for purposes of credit risk.

TITLE VI : OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT RISK
==========================================================
Article 381 : Meaning of Credit Valuation Adjustment
==========================================================
For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title II, "Credit Valuation Adjustment" or "CVA" means an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty. That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.
==========================================================
Article 382 : Scope
==========================================================
1. An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk.
==========================================================
2. An institution shall include securities financing transactions in the calculation of own funds required by paragraph 1 if the competent authority determines that the institution's CVA risk exposures arising from those transactions are material.
==========================================================
3. Transactions with a qualifying central counterparty and a client's transactions with a clearing member, when the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the client and a qualifying central counterparty and the transactions give rise to a trade exposure of the clearing member to the qualifying central counterparty, are excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk.
==========================================================
4. The following transactions shall be excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk

Article 383 : Advanced method
==========================================================
1. An institution which has permission to use an internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363 (1) shall, for all transactions for which it has permission to use the IMM for determining the exposure value for the associated counterparty credit risk exposure in accordance with Article 283, determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk by modelling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads on the CVAs of all counterparties of those transactions, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386.
==========================================================
An institution shall use its internal model for determining the own funds requirements for the specific risk associated with traded debt positions and shall apply a 99 % confidence interval and a 10-day equivalent holding period. The internal model shall be used in such way that it simulates changes in the credit spreads of counterparties, but does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, including changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.
==========================================================
The own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
ti = the time of the i-th revaluation, starting from t0=0;
==========================================================
tT = the longest contractual maturity across the netting sets with the counterparty;
==========================================================
si = is the credit spread of the counterparty at tenor ti, used to calculate the CVA of the counterparty. Where the credit default swap spread of the counterparty is available, an institution shall use that spread. Where such a credit default swap spread is not available, an institution shall use a proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty;
==========================================================
LGDMKT = the LGD of the counterparty that shall be based on the spread of a market instrument of the counterparty if a counterparty instrument is available. Where a counterparty instrument is not available, it shall be based on the proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty.
==========================================================
The first factor within the sum represents an approximation of the market implied marginal probability of a default occurring between times ti-1 and ti;
==========================================================
EEi = the expected exposure to the counterparty at revaluation time ti, where exposures of different netting sets for such counterparty are added, and where the longest maturity of each netting set is given by the longest contractual maturity inside the netting set; An institution shall apply the treatment set out in paragraph 3 in the case of margined trading, if the institution uses the EPE measure referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) for margined trades;
==========================================================
Di = the default risk-free discount factor at time ti, where D0 =1.
==========================================================
2. When calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk for a counterparty, an institution shall base all inputs into its internal model for specific risk of debt instruments on the following formulae (whichever is appropriate) 
==========================================================
where the model is based on full repricing, the formula in paragraph 1 shall be used directly
==========================================================
where the model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, an institution shall base each credit spread sensitivity ("Regulatory CS01") on the following formula ❬For the final time bucket i=T, the corresponding formula is❭
==========================================================
where the model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in credit spreads, an institution shall use the following formula ❬❭
==========================================================
where the model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit spreads (spread gamma), the gammas shall be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 1
==========================================================
3. An institution using the EPE measure for collateralised OTC derivatives referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) shall, when determining the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1, do both of the following

4. An institution which is permitted by the competent authority in accordance with Article 283 to use IMM to calculate exposure values in relation to the majority of its business, but which uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for smaller portfolios, and which has permission to use the market risk internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363(1) may, subject to permission from the competent authorities, calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1 for the non-IMM netting sets. Competent authorities shall grant this permission only if the institution uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for a limited number of smaller portfolios.
==========================================================
For the purposes of a calculation under the preceding subparagraph and where the IMM model does not produce an expected exposure profile, an institution shall do both of the following 
==========================================================
5. An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 364(1) and Articles 365 and 367 as the sum of non-stressed and stressed Value-at-Risk, which shall be calculated as described in the following list 
==========================================================
for the non-stressed Value-at-Risk, current parameter calibrations for expected exposure as set out in the first subparagraph of Article 292(2), shall be used
==========================================================
for the stressed Value-at-Risk, future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in the second subparagraph of Article 292(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters shall be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-year stress period used for the exposure parameters
==========================================================
the three-times multiplier used in the calculation of own funds requirements based on a Value-at-Risk and a stressed Value-at-Risk in accordance with 364(1) will apply to these calculations. EBA shall monitor for consistency any supervisory discretion used to apply a higher multiplier than that three-times multiplier to the Value-at-Risk and stressed Value-at-Risk inputs to the CVA charge. Competent authorities applying a multiplier higher than three shall provide a written justification to EBA

If lower than a daily frequency is used, for the purpose of the calculation specified in points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of Article 364(1) institutions shall take the average over three months
==========================================================
6. For exposures to a counterparty, for which the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments does not produce a proxy spread that is appropriate with respect to the criteria of rating, industry and region of the counterparty, the institution shall use the method set out in Article 384 to calculate the own funds requirement for CVA risk.
==========================================================

==========================================================
Article 384 : Standardised method
==========================================================
1. An institution which does not calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk for its counterparties in accordance with Article 383 shall calculate a portfolio own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty in accordance with the following formula, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
h = the one-year risk horizon (in units of a year); h = 1;
==========================================================
wi = the weight applicable to counterparty "i".
==========================================================
Counterparty "i" shall be mapped to one of the six weights wi based on an external credit assessment by a nominated ECAI, as set out in Table 1. For a counterparty for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available, an institution using the approach in Title II, Chapter 3 shall map the internal rating of the counterparty to one of the external credit assessment. For a counterparty for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available, an institution using the approach in Title II, Chapter 2 shall assign wi=1.0 % to this counterparty. However, if an institution uses Article 128 to risk weight counterparty credit risk exposures to this counterparty, wi=3.0 % shall be assigned; = the total counterparty credit risk exposure value of counterparty "i" (summed across its netting sets) including the effect of collateral in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of Title II, Chapter 6 as applicable to the calculation of the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk for that counterparty. An institution using one of the methods set out in Sections 3 and 4 of Title II, Chapter 6, may use as EADitotal the fully adjusted exposure value in accordance with Article 223(5).
==========================================================
For an institution not using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, the exposure shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
==========================================================
Bi = the notional of purchased single name credit default swap hedges (summed if more than one position) referencing counterparty "i" and used to hedge CVA risk.
==========================================================
That notional amount shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
==========================================================
Bind = is the full notional of one or more index credit default swap of purchased protection used to hedge CVA risk.
==========================================================
That notional amount shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
==========================================================
wind = is the weight applicable to index hedges.
==========================================================
An institution shall determine wind by calculating a weighted average of wi that are applicable to the individual constituents of the index;
==========================================================
Mi = the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty i.
==========================================================
For an institution using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, Mi shall be calculated in accordance with Article 162(2)(g). However, for that purpose, Mi shall not be capped at five years but at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set.
==========================================================
For an institution not using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, Mi is the average notional weighted maturity as referred to in point (b) of Article 162(2). However, for that purpose, Mi shall not be capped at five years but at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set. = the maturity of the hedge instrument with notional Bi (the quantities Mi hedge Bi are to be summed if these are several positions);
==========================================================
Mind = the maturity of the index hedge.
==========================================================
In the case of more than one index hedge position, Mind is the notional-weighted maturity.
==========================================================
2. Where a counterparty is included in an index on which a credit default swap used for hedging counterparty credit risk is based, the institution may subtract the notional amount attributable to that counterparty in accordance with its reference entity weight from the index CDS notional amount and treat it as a single name hedge (Bi) of the individual counterparty with maturity based on the maturity of the index.

Article 385 : Alternative to using CVA methods to calculating own funds requirements
==========================================================
As an alternative to Article 384, for instruments referred to in Article 382 and subject to the prior consent of the competent authority, institutions using the Original Exposure Method as laid down in Article 275, may apply a multiplication factor of 10 to the resulting risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty credit risk for those exposures instead of calculating own funds requirements for CVA risk.
==========================================================
Article 386 : Eligible hedges
==========================================================
1. Hedges shall be "eligible hedges" for the purposes of the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Articles 383 and 384 only where they are used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk and managed as such, and are one of the following 
==========================================================
The requirement in point (b) that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected in the Value-at-Risk shall also apply to cases where a proxy is used for the spread of a counterparty.
==========================================================
For all counterparties for which a proxy is used, an institution shall use reasonable basis time series out of a representative group of similar names for which a spread is available.
==========================================================
If the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is not reflected to the satisfaction of the competent authority, then an institution shall reflect only 50 % of the notional amount of index hedges in the Value-at-Risk.
==========================================================
Over-hedging of the exposures with single name credit default swaps under the method laid out in Article 383 is not allowed.
==========================================================
2. An institution shall not reflect other types of counterparty risk hedges in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk. In particular, tranched or nth-to-default credit default swaps and credit linked notes are not eligible hedges for the purposes the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk.
==========================================================
3. Eligible hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk shall not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk as set out in Title IV or treated as credit risk mitigation other than for the counterparty credit risk of the same portfolio of transaction.

6. For the purpose of this paragraph, structural measures mean measures adopted by a Member State and implemented by the relevant competent authorities of that Member State before the entry into force of a legal act explicitly harmonising such measures, that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability.
==========================================================
Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 400(1)(f), where Member States adopt national laws requiring structural measures to be taken within a banking group, competent authorities may require the institutions of the banking group which hold deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes (30) or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country to apply a large exposure limit below 25 % but not lower than 15 % between 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015, and than 10 % from 1 July 2015 on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) to intragroup exposures where these exposures consist of exposures to an entity that does not belong to the same subgroup as regards the structural measures.
==========================================================
For the purpose of this paragraph, the following conditions shall be met 
==========================================================
Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.

Otherwise, the Commission shall accept the proposed national measures for an initial period of 2 years and where appropriate the measures may be subject to amendment.
==========================================================
The Commission shall only reject the proposed national measures if it considers the proposed national measures entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market or to the free movement of capital in accordance with the provisions of the TFEU.

Article 397 : Calculating additional own funds requirements for large exposures in the trading book
==========================================================
1. The excess referred to in Article 395(5)(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question which attract the highest specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V, the sum of which equals the amount of the excess referred to in point (a) of Article 395(5).
==========================================================
2. Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components.
==========================================================
3. As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V.

Article 401 : Calculating the effect of the use of credit risk mitigation techniques
==========================================================
1. For calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) an institution may use the "fully adjusted exposure value" as calculated under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 taking into account the credit risk mitigation, volatility adjustments, and any maturity mismatch (E*).
==========================================================
2. An institution permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may, subject to a permission by the competent authorities recognise the effects of financial collateral in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1).
==========================================================
Competent authorities shall grant the permission referred to in preceding subparagraph only if the institution can estimate the effects of financial collateral on their exposures separately from other LGD-relevant aspects.
==========================================================
The estimates produced by the institution shall be sufficiently suitable for reducing the exposure value for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of Article 395.
==========================================================
Where an institution is permitted to use its own estimates of the effects of financial collateral, it shall do so on a basis consistent with the approach adopted in the calculation of the own funds requirements in accordance with this Regulation.
==========================================================
Institutions permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, which do not calculate the value of their exposures using the method referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the approach set out in Article 403(1)(b) for calculating the value of exposures.
==========================================================
3. An institution that makes use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or is permitted to use the method described in paragraph 2 of this Article in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken.
==========================================================
These periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.
==========================================================
The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of such risks.
==========================================================
In the event that the periodic stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral taken than would be permitted to be taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2 as appropriate, the value of collateral permitted to be recognised in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall be reduced accordingly.
==========================================================
Institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk 
==========================================================
Article 402 : Exposures arising from mortgage lending
==========================================================
1. For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 125(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
2. For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 126(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
3. An institution may treat an exposure to a counterparty that results from a reverse repurchase agreement under which the institution has purchased from the counterparty non-accessory independent mortgage liens on immovable property of third parties as a number of individual exposures to each of those third parties, provided that all of the following conditions are met 
==========================================================
For these purposes, the institution shall assume that it has an exposure to each of those third parties for the amount of the claim that the counterparty has on the third party instead of the corresponding amount of the exposure to the counterparty. The remainder of the exposure to the counter party, if any, shall continue to be treated as an exposure to the counter party.
==========================================================
Article 403 : Substitution approach
==========================================================
1. Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party, or secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution may treat the portion of the exposure which is guaranteed as having been incurred to the guarantor rather than to the client provided that the unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2.
==========================================================
1. Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party, or secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution may treat the portion of the exposure collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral as having been incurred to the third party rather than to the client, if the exposure is secured by collateral and provided that the collateralised portion of the exposure would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2.
==========================================================
The approach referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be used by an institution where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection.
==========================================================
For the purpose of this Part, an institution may use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph only where it is permitted to use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the Financial Collateral Simple Method for the purposes of Article 92.
==========================================================
2. Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1, where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated the amount of the exposure deemed to be covered shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.
==========================================================
2. Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1, a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection shall be treated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.
==========================================================
2. Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1, partial coverage may be recognised in accordance with the treatment set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.

==========================================================
The first subparagraph shall apply only where credit institutions, investment firms or financial institutions which created the securitised exposures have committed themselves to adhere to the requirements set out in Article 408 and deliver, in a timely manner, to the originator or sponsor and to the EU parent credit institution, EU financial holding company or EU mixed financial holding company the information needed to satisfy the requirements referred to in Article 409.

2. Institutions, other than when acting as originators or sponsors or original lenders, shall establish formal procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance information on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions. Where relevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, institutions shall have the information set out in this subparagraph not only on the underlying securitisation tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those securitisation tranches.
==========================================================
Institutions shall also apply the same standards of analysis to participations or underwritings in securitisation issues purchased from third parties whether such participations or underwritings are to be held on their trading or non-trading book.

Where an institution does not meet the requirements in Article 405, 406 or 409 in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the institution, the competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1 250 %) which shall apply to the relevant securitisation positions in the manner specified in Article 245(6) or Article 337(3) respectively. The additional risk weight shall progressively increase with each subsequent infringement of the due diligence provisions.
==========================================================
The competent authorities shall take into account the exemptions for certain securitisations provided in Article 405(3) by reducing the risk weight it would otherwise impose under this Article in respect of a securitisation to which Article 405(3) applies.

Sponsor and originator institutions shall apply the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting in accordance with the requirements of Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU to exposures to be securitised as they apply to exposures to be held in their own non-trading book. To this end the same processes for approving and, where relevant, amending, renewing and re-financing credits shall be applied by the originator and sponsor institutions.
==========================================================
Where the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of this Article are not met, Article 245(1) shall not be applied by an originator institution and that originator institution shall not be allowed to exclude the securitised exposures from the calculation of its capital requirements under this Regulation.
==========================================================
Article 409 : Disclosure to investors
==========================================================
Institutions acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender shall disclose to investors the level of their commitment under Article 405 to maintain a net economic interest in the securitisation. Sponsor and originator institutions shall ensure that prospective investors have readily available access to all materially relevant data on the credit quality and performance of the individual underlying exposures, cash flows and collateral supporting a securitisation exposure as well as such information that is necessary to conduct comprehensive and well informed stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures. For that purpose, materially relevant data shall be determined as at the date of the securitisation and where appropriate due to the nature of the securitisation thereafter.

For the purposes of this Part, the following definitions apply 
==========================================================
Article 412 : Liquidity coverage requirement
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity buffers which are adequate to face any possible imbalance between liquidity inflows and outflows under gravely stressed conditions over a period of thirty days. During times of stress, institutions may use their liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows.
==========================================================
2. Institutions shall not count double liquidity inflows and liquid assets.
==========================================================
3. Institutions may use the liquid assets referred to in paragraph 1 to meet their obligations under stressed circumstances as specified under Article 414.
==========================================================
4. The provisions set out in Title II shall apply exclusively for the purposes of specifying reporting obligations set out in Article 415.
==========================================================
5. Member States may maintain or introduce national provisions in the area of liquidity requirements before binding minimum standards for liquidity coverage requirements are specified and fully introduced in the Union in accordance with Article 460. Member States or competent authorities may require domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions, to maintain a higher liquidity coverage requirement up to 100 % until the binding minimum standard is fully introduced at a rate of 100 % in accordance with Article 460.
==========================================================
Article 413 : Stable Funding
==========================================================
1. Institutions shall ensure that long term obligations are adequately met with a diversity of stable funding instruments under both normal and stressed conditions.

2. The provisions set out in Title III shall apply exclusively for the purposes of specifying reporting obligations set out in Article 415.
==========================================================
3. Member States may maintain or introduce national provisions in the area of stable funding requirements before binding minimum standards for net stable funding requirements are specified and introduced in the Union in accordance with Article 510.
==========================================================
Article 414 : Compliance with liquidity requirements
==========================================================
Where an institution does not meet, or expects not to meet the requirement set out in Article 412 or the general obligation set out in Article 413(1), including during times of stress, it shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall submit without undue delay to the competent authorities a plan for the timely restoration of compliance with Article 412 or Article 413(1). Until compliance has been restored, the institution shall report the items referred to in Title II or Title III, as appropriate, daily by the end of each business day unless the competent authority authorises a lower reporting frequency and a longer reporting delay. Competent authorities shall only grant such authorisations based on the individual situation of an institution and taking into account the scale and complexity of the institution's activities. They shall monitor the implementation of the restoration plan and shall require a more speedy restoration if appropriate.

The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in the first sentence of Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets.

7. Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible in the stock of liquid assets, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 6, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.

1. Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days.

2. A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows:
==========================================================
where:
==========================================================
EBRMi = exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member;

==========================================================
For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP.
==========================================================
